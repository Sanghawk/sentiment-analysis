**Technical Requirements Document: Scalable ETL Process for Coindesk Article Scraping**

**1. Overview**
This document outlines the technical requirements for implementing a scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process that scrapes Coindesk article links from their sitemap, processes the extracted links to fetch article data, and stores the structured data in S3 and PostgreSQL. The system should be scalable to handle increasing processing demands efficiently.

**2. System Components**

1. **Script 1: Sitemap Scraper**
   - Continuously scrapes the Coindesk sitemap pages.
   - Extracts links to articles.
   - Pushes the links into a queue for processing.
2. **Script 2: Article Processor**
   - Fetches a URL from the queue.
   - Checks if the URL already exists in PostgreSQL.
   - If not present, extracts article content and metadata.
   - Stores the extracted data into S3 and PostgreSQL.
   - Runs continuously even if the queue is empty.
   - Supports running multiple instances to scale processing speed.

**3. Technical Requirements**

### 3.1 Data Sources

- **Coindesk Sitemap:** XML pages containing URLs of published articles.
- **Article Pages:** HTML pages that need to be parsed for structured data extraction.

### 3.2 Data Pipeline

- **Queueing System:**

  - A distributed queue such as **RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Redis Queue** to store extracted article URLs.
  - Ensures that URLs are consumed by multiple instances of Script 2 efficiently.

- **Database Storage:**
  - **PostgreSQL** for structured storage of extracted article metadata.
  - **S3** for storing raw extracted article content (e.g., JSON, HTML snapshots).

### 3.3 Scalability Requirements

- **Multiple Instances of Script 2:**

  - Script 2 should support parallel execution across multiple worker instances.
  - Workers should be stateless and pick URLs from the queue dynamically.
  - Autoscaling should be enabled (e.g., Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, AWS Lambda, or EC2 Auto Scaling).

- **Load Balancing and Fault Tolerance:**
  - The queue should support at-least-once delivery.
  - Failed article extractions should be retried with an exponential backoff strategy.
  - Logging and monitoring should track failed URLs.

### 3.4 Data Processing

- **Deduplication:**

  - Before extracting content, check PostgreSQL if the URL is already processed.
  - If the URL exists, discard it to prevent redundant processing.

- **Data Extraction:**
  - Parse HTML to extract article metadata (title, author, publication date, body text, etc.).
  - Store structured data in PostgreSQL.
  - Store raw HTML or JSON in S3.

### 3.5 Monitoring and Logging

- **Logging Framework:**

  - Centralized logging using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or CloudWatch.
  - Track scraping errors, queue processing delays, and system health.

- **Metrics and Alerts:**
  - Monitor queue depth to adjust worker instance count dynamically.
  - Set up alerts for high failure rates or excessive queue backlog.

### 3.6 Deployment and Infrastructure

- **Containerization:**

  - Both scripts should be containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

- **Orchestration:**

  - Kubernetes for managing scalability and deployment.
  - AWS Lambda for a serverless approach if required.

- **Database Management:**
  - PostgreSQL hosted on **AWS RDS** or **Google Cloud SQL**.
  - S3 for object storage.

**4. Development and Production Workflow**

### 4.1 Development Workflow

1. **Local Development:**
   - Develop scripts in a local Python environment using virtual environments (venv or conda).
   - Use SQLite as a lightweight database alternative for local testing.
   - Run a local instance of Redis or Kafka for queue testing.
2. **Unit and Integration Testing:**
   - Implement unit tests for individual functions using `pytest`.
   - Write integration tests to ensure correct interactions between the scraper, queue, and storage components.
   - Use mock services or test databases to avoid unnecessary external API calls.
3. **Containerization:**
   - Build Docker images for both scripts.
   - Use `docker-compose` to simulate the full stack locally.
   - Ensure compatibility with production infrastructure.
4. **Staging Deployment:**
   - Deploy to a staging environment (e.g., a Kubernetes cluster with a separate database and queue instance).
   - Test autoscaling, queue processing, and database interactions in a production-like environment.
5. **Code Review and Version Control:**
   - Use Git with feature branches and pull requests.
   - Perform code reviews before merging to the main branch.
   - Enforce CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployments.

### 4.2 Production Workflow

1. **Deployment Strategy:**
   - Deploy using Kubernetes, AWS Lambda, or serverless functions.
   - Use a rolling update strategy to minimize downtime.
2. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Set up real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
   - Configure alerts for failures, queue buildup, or slow processing times.
3. **Scaling and Performance Optimization:**
   - Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to manage worker instances dynamically.
   - Tune database queries and caching strategies for efficient data retrieval.
4. **Logging and Error Handling:**

   - Aggregate logs in a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK, CloudWatch, or Datadog).
   - Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for failed requests.

5. **Regular Maintenance and Improvements:**
   - Schedule periodic database optimizations and cleanups.
   - Regularly update dependencies and security patches.
   - Continuously analyze system performance and apply optimizations.

**5. Implementation Considerations**

- Implement **retry logic** for failed extractions.
- Ensure that the system is **idempotent** to prevent duplicate processing.
- Implement **rate limiting** and request throttling to avoid getting blocked by Coindesk.

**6. Conclusion**
This ETL pipeline will ensure efficient, scalable, and fault-tolerant extraction of Coindesk articles while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements. The design supports dynamic scaling to handle increased workload demands as necessary.
