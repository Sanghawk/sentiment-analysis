### **Roadmap: Scalable ETL Process for Coindesk Article Scraping**

---

## **1. Phase 1: Research and Planning**

- [ ] Identify the best queueing system (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Queue).
- [ ] Define database schema for PostgreSQL (article metadata storage).
- [ ] Define S3 storage structure for raw extracted articles.
- [ ] Set up local development environment (Docker, virtual environments, mock services).

---

## **2. Phase 2: Development**

### **2.1 Sitemap Scraper (Script 1)**

- [ ] Implement a script to fetch Coindesk sitemap pages.
- [ ] Parse sitemap to extract article URLs.
- [ ] Push extracted URLs to the queue.
- [ ] Implement logging and error handling.
- [ ] Test sitemap parsing with sample pages.

### **2.2 Article Processor (Script 2)**

- [ ] Implement script to fetch URLs from the queue.
- [ ] Check if URL exists in PostgreSQL before processing.
- [ ] Extract article metadata (title, author, date, body text).
- [ ] Store metadata in PostgreSQL.
- [ ] Store raw article content in S3.
- [ ] Implement retries and exponential backoff for failed requests.
- [ ] Implement logging and error handling.
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests.

---

## **3. Phase 3: Infrastructure and Deployment**

- [ ] Containerize both scripts using Docker.
- [ ] Set up a local queueing system for development testing.
- [ ] Deploy PostgreSQL (AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL).
- [ ] Set up S3 bucket for article storage.
- [ ] Deploy scripts to a staging environment (Kubernetes, AWS Lambda, or EC2).
- [ ] Implement autoscaling for Script 2 workers.

---

## **4. Phase 4: Monitoring and Optimization**

- [ ] Set up logging system (ELK Stack, CloudWatch, or Datadog).
- [ ] Implement real-time monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana).
- [ ] Define alerting system for failures and queue buildup.
- [ ] Optimize database queries for efficient lookups.
- [ ] Improve scraping efficiency with concurrent requests and caching.

---

## **5. Phase 5: Production Deployment**

- [ ] Deploy the full pipeline to a production environment.
- [ ] Perform load testing and optimize for scalability.
- [ ] Monitor system performance in real-time.
- [ ] Implement ongoing maintenance tasks (database cleanup, log rotation).
- [ ] Continuously analyze and refine the system for improvements.

---

## **6. Phase 6: Future Enhancements**

- [ ] Implement support for additional news sources.
- [ ] Introduce NLP processing for article categorization and sentiment analysis.
- [ ] Improve rate-limiting mechanisms to prevent IP bans.
- [ ] Optimize storage costs by compressing or archiving old articles.
