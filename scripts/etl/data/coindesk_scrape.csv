The news follows Tuesday’s announcement of Aya Miyaguchi  leaving that role to become  the EF’s new president. The  leadership  shake-up follows intense debate among the community about the EF’s role in the ecosystem, as  some have blamed the organization  and its leadership for the blockchain’s token ether (ETH) price lagging behind other cryptocurrencies, while the blockchain  attracted for the first time less new developers  than its competitor Solana. Wang has been at the EF since 2017, where  she helped do research  on concepts  like shardin g, as well as contributed to Ethereum’s major overhaul  known as “the Merge.”  Stańczak founded Nerthermind, one of the largest software or clients that operate the Ethereum blockchain. “Over the next few years, the Ethereum ecosystem needs to navigate the challenging transition from being an early-stage project serving a small number of enthusiasts to being a robust permissionless censorship-resistant base layer of the global finance and software stack,” the Foundation said in their blog post. More shuffling In addition to Wang and Stańczak assuming their new roles, ex-EF researcher Danny Ryan shared that he would be joining Etherealize, the  new project aimed at bringing ETH  to Wall Street. The firm was founded by former banker Vivek Raman, who shared previously with CoinDesk that one of the goals of Etherealize is to bridge the gap between Ethereum and the banks by educating institutions and marketing ETH as a serious crypto asset. In  a post shared  on X, Ryan said that he intends “to build a new Ethereum institution with Real World Ethereum as its north star.” “The world is ready to come on-chain, and we’re here to do the hard work necessary to make it happen,” Ryan added.

A recent initiative is pushing for a constitutional amendment requiring the SNB to hold bitcoin in its reserves alongside gold, the article said.

New era The narrative The crypto industry racked up a number of early wins in the first month (and week) of Donald Trump's second term as U.S. president. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced it would drop or close half a dozen open investigations and ongoing cases, and asked courts to pause two more. Why it matters The crypto industry clearly won big during the 2024 election, and it's only just beginning to see what that means. Questions of how it actually should or shouldn't be regulated are now up in the air. Breaking it down Over the last week and change, the SEC filed to withdraw its case against crypto exchange Coinbase, pause its cases against Binance and Tron and informed ConsenSys, OpenSea, Robinhood, Uniswap and Gemini it would close its cases or investigations into those platforms. These announcements come on the heels of SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce announcing she would head up a new crypto task force at the regulatory agency and publishing a number of open questions to the general public about how securities law might apply to different types of cryptocurrencies and defining how the SEC would oversee this industry. The SEC also withdrew staff accounting bulletin 121, an accounting standard much of the industry hated. While there are a number of investigations or cases still outstanding, it's clear the SEC has taken a sharply diverging tack under Acting Chair Mark Uyeda from when former Chair Gary Gensler helmed the agency. Commissioner Hester Peirce said the SEC was now working to develop more policy that would guide the Division of Enforcement's future actions, rather than have these enforcement actions ""write regulatory policy."" ""We're really trying to get back to using our enforcement division for its intended purpose, and letting the regulatory divisions do the hard work of figuring out how to craft rules, guidance [and] interpretations,"" she told CoinDesk in an interview. ""And then enforcement has a role after that, of course, to enforce the rules that are on the books. But this has just been an area where we've kind of gone about it backwards, and we're trying to right the ship here."" The industry has been taking  a victory lap  with the withdrawals and dropped cases (and to be clear,  it's not just the SEC  withdrawing enforcement actions and investigations). Amanda Tuminelli, the chief legal officer at DeFi Education Fund, a decentralized finance-focused lobbying group, said any groups in the crypto sector should be more confident they would not be sued ""for a mere registration violation."" ""I don't think that we've won. I won't think that we have won until there are clear final rules on the books that make it clear, that are durable wins that make it clear that the industry is going to be able to innovate and exist for years in the future,"" she said in an interview. On the other side of this argument, the SEC — and Congress — are ""actively welcoming"" chaos from the crypto sector to the broader financial system, said Corey Frayer, the director of Investor Protection for the Consumer Federation of America and a former SEC senior adviser to Gensler. ""The SEC is not just abandoning enforcement actions, it's actively building an unregulated market for crypto assets,"" he said in an interview. This could create risk for contagion, he said, referencing FTX and Silicon Valley Bank's collapses. FTX had an issue with leverage (and the various FTX-affiliated tokens, which were used as collateral but lost their value following the exchange's collapse). ""As we’ve learned from prior financial crises, ramping up leverage risks that any single bad bet or any significant move in the value of one asset or intermediary will crash the entire crypto sector,"" Frayer said. Congress's efforts may take some time. Earlier this week, lawmakers with the Senate Banking Committee's new digital assets subcommittee convened its first hearing focused on future legislation. Lewis Cohen, an attorney who's long been active in the crypto sector and a witness at the hearing, said developers had ""raced ahead of the legal and policy frameworks designed decades ago."" ""Perhaps most critically, this uncertain regulatory environment has left consumers and users of digital assets at risk,"" he said. ""A clear, practical and flexible federal statutory regime is urgently needed to address activity involving digital assets in both the primary and the secondary markets."" Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Timothy Massad suggested Congress should focus on stablecoins and hold off on any kind of market structure legislation, at least until his former agency and the SEC have had a chance to work on rulemakings and guidance first. Tuminelli said she was worried that some builders might take these recent signs to mean ""it's just open season,"" even though she expects law enforcement agencies to continue cracking down on outright criminal activity. Other recent incidents, like Bybit's $1.5 billion hack, are also poor signs for the industry. ""We have things like Bybit to worry about, and we do have to worry about national security concerns and things like that,"" she said. ""So there are still going to be compliance issues that people need to pay attention to, even as there is a much greater runway in front of us.""

I'm told it's unlikely his account is compromised though. ETF bonanza Outside of enforcement actions, the crypto industry is looking to the SEC for another purpose: Approving a broad swath of new exchange-traded products backed by, or tracking the prices of digital assets that weren't under significant discussion a year ago.

Unlike in previous years, where there was uncertainty about how far an application might go (during the race to launch a spot bitcoin (BTC) and later ether (ETH) ETF), the expectation now seems to be that retail and institutional traders will soon be able to gain exposure to these digital assets through this type of regulated investment product.

The company’s DeFi index (KSDEFI) has outpaced ether (ETH) since the instrument’s inception in October 2023, bringing in roughly 75% returns in that span of time. That’s remarkable considering that most of the protocols included in the index are built on Ethereum. (Credit: Kaiko Research)   “This outperformance may persist into the latter half of 2025, as several assets within the index benefit from strong tailwinds,” the report said. “This trend highlights the decreasing correlation between the DeFi index and ETH over time, as the decentralized finance sector continues to expand beyond the Ethereum ecosystem.” The index is composed of 11 DeFi tokens, the most heavily weighted being UNI, AAVE and ONDO. At least four of these tokens have powerful tailwinds for the rest of the year, the report said. For example, regulatory developments in the U.S. may open up possibilities for decentralized exchange Uniswap and decentralized lender Aave to implement fee switches for each of their respective tokens, meaning that protocol fees may end up getting distributed to UNI and AAVE holders. Tokenization protocol Ondo Finance, for its part, will likely benefit from an acceleration of the tokenization trend as Wall Street keeps wading deeper into crypto, the report said. “Regulatory constraints in key markets have been a significant hurdle [since 2020], but they are only part of the challenge. DeFi has also faced structural issues, including high user friction due to fees and security concerns.

In early-hours Feb. 28,  the price  had dipped below $80,000. CoinDesk’s Market Index, which tracks the broader digital assets market, has fallen  12% in the last five days. CoinDesk’s Markets Editor Omkar Godbole analyzed the daily price action,  tracking ETF outflows ,  historical analogies , and  macro correlations . On the regulatory front, the SEC dropped major cases against  Uniswap ,  Coinbase , and  MetaMask (ConsenSys) . It also sought to end a fraud case against  TRON and Justin Sun . Our regulatory team of Nik De, Jesse Hamilton and Cheyenne Ligon were all over the news, as usual. Meanwhile, it looks like the SEC will not be treating  memecoins as securities , Ligon reported. Stablecoins were another big theme, as issuers argued over the parameters of a  new law covering the most used form of digital assets. Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of stablecoin issuer Circle, said USD-backed stablecoin issuers  should be required to register in the U.S. , in a clear tilt at Circle’s biggest rival, Tether (regulatory reporter Camomile Shumba had that).

These models suggest portfolios and rebalances which are then followed by advisors and platforms who can also request adjustments to the models based on their investment needs. BlackRock added a 1% to 2% allocation to IBIT in its target allocation portfolio that allows for alternative assets, according to James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. In a report from Thursday, Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF models, wrote that there are “several substantive arguments that support bitcoin’s long-term investment merit.” According to Gates, this includes the crypto asset’s novel store of value and global monetary alternative, as well as hedge to the U.S. dollar hegemony and political instability, and proxy play on the “offline” to “online” digital transition of goods and services. “Collectively, these features may help provide unique and additive sources of risk premia and diversification to traditional multi-asset portfolios,” Gates wrote. The model represents one of IBIT’s smaller portfolios, however, the step is significant given that it is the first time BlackRock had made the decision to add IBIT to any of their models. “This is a big deal because this is the first of those models to add bitcoin,” said Seyffart. “It probably won’t be the last but bitcoin is also a lightning rod for many — some will hate this while others will love it — so I don’t know if or when they would add IBIT to their primary models that have a lot more money tracking them.” BlackRock’s model portfolios manage around $150 billion in assets as of December 31, 2024.

Weekend looms All major stock markets, of course, are closed on the weekends. Even foreign exchange, touted for decades as a market that never sleeps, actually shuts down between Friday and Sunday evenings. Crypto, however, has no such break, but traders could be forgiven for clamoring for one. Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick a couple of weeks ago pointed out that weekends have not been kind for bitcoin of late. While last weekend was very modestly positive for the world's largest crypto, the trend prior to that for had been lower prices, often sharply so. ""Are risk assets really going to rally into [this] weekend now we have had the bad news,"" asked Kendrick in a note Friday morning. His answer is likely that they won't. A contrarian take is that they just might. After all, macro risk — at least as defined by President Trump's belligerent tariff stance — could be fully priced in. He's promised that 25% tariffs will begin for Mexico and Canada and 10% for China this coming Tuesday. How might things get worse than that? Will he bump them to 50%? Instead, with prices having fallen so far (stock markets stumbled as well this week), it might be the bears who are in the riskiest spot over the next 48+ hours if — for instance — a deal averting or substantially delaying the tariffs were to be reached.

20250228,opinion,The elimination of capital gains taxes on crypto might not be the huge boon to American investors that it would appear to be.,17:22,Opinion,20250228,6e2ce3ad-b3f7-4002-9153-9e10ec0a4ff8,20250228,"In January, following Donald Trump's inauguration,  reports  emerged claiming that his son, Eric Trump, had confirmed that U.S.-based cryptocurrencies would eventually be exempt from capital gains tax, while non-U.S. based cryptocurrencies would face a 30% tax. The elimination of capital gains taxes on U.S.-based cryptocurrencies might sound like a dream come true for American investors, but it won't come without a price. Whether it turns into a net negative for the global crypto industry — well, we'll just have to wait and see. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Node Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . But there are some glaring red flags. 1. Markets may wobble after confirmation. If this new rule actually gets approved and takes effect, be prepared for market turbulence as U.S. investors could dump non-U.S. cryptos,  take the tax hit  and rotate some of their capital into domestic options. This could increase sell pressure on global projects, particularly those with significant U.S. investor exposure. But that would be the least of the concerns — this could have far-reaching, long-term consequences for the entire crypto industry. 2. Making this change before sound regulations are in place could be harmful. This elimination of taxes on crypto investments could trigger a surge in the creation of new cryptocurrencies from the U.S., similar to the 2017 Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom — in which  nearly 80% of projects  had collapsed or turned out to be scams within two years. If the U.S. government  removes capital gains tax  before implementing clear and solid regulations, we could see a repeat of that chaos, but on a much larger scale. A zero capital gains tax would almost certainly lure in U.S. retail investors who’ve never dabbled in crypto, drawn by the obvious tax advantage. But if bad actors flood the space and  take advantage of them , it could drive these newcomers away from crypto entirely. 3. Potential harm to the global crypto industry. The U.S. may be home to major crypto projects like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Hedera (HBAR), but it’s also been a breeding ground for scam tokens. In 2024, the FBI even issued a  warning  about criminals creating fake crypto tokens that mimicked legitimate ones, preying on unsuspecting investors. In addition, global crypto startups may have a more challenging time securing funding if U.S. venture firms start favoring local projects to maximize tax-free returns on token allocations. This could drain investment from emerging markets, where crypto is often used for real-world financial inclusion. Such a change would also likely bring back many U.S. firms back home after they left because of the  SEC’s enforcement-heavy approach  under the Biden administration. Even if other countries jumped on the bandwagon with their own zero capital gains tax for local cryptos, it might backfire. The market would likely be flooded with new tokens, trading would become more fragmented, and liquidity would dry up for most of them. While countries like the UAE and Cayman Islands already have  zero capital gains tax  on crypto, they apply it universally, not just to locally-created crypto tokens. Conclusion The U.S. taking this approach risks skewing the market, incentivizing artificial token creation and isolating American investors from the global crypto economy. What seems like a tax break now might end up killing competition, pumping money into scams and hurting crypto’s credibility in the long run.",14:40,14:40,en,20250228,Why Trump’s Potential Plan to Make Crypto Gains Tax-Free Could Be a Bad Idea,14:40,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/02/28/why-trump-s-potential-plan-to-make-crypto-gains-tax-free-could-be-a-bad-idea,Why Trump’s Potential Plan to Make Crypto Gains Tax-Free Could Be a Bad Idea,CoinDesk,"crypto-taxes,donald-trump",article_page,robin-singh,metered

Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise Asset Management, noted that CME’s crypto derivatives have helped pave the way for regulated financial products, including ETFs. Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital added that such products give sophisticated investors more tools to manage risk and exposure. With Solana gaining traction among developers and investors, the addition of SOL futures highlights the increasing demand for regulated crypto trading products. It could also pave the way for SOL exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Increased volatility in cryptocurrencies mirrors trends in traditional markets. Compare the 10% jump in the Volmex BVIV, which tracks the 30-day implied volatility in bitcoin, with the equal increase in the MOVE index, which measures the implied volatility of U.S. Treasury notes. The VIX, Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, has risen by 14%.  These movements, coupled with a sell-off in growth-sensitive commodity currencies like the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars, are indicative of jitters in the macroeconomy, primarily driven by  renewed concerns over potential Trump tariffs , prompting a rotation towards less volatile assets. ""U.S. domestic policies have become unstable, and the White House seems happy to take advantage of this instability,"" said Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin. ""Given the challenges investors face in obtaining accurate forward-looking guidance, many are more inclined to hold low-volatility assets ... Traders need to liquidate positions to reduce their exposure to specific assets before transitioning to other markets, which explains the decline across almost all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies."" Volatility looks set to remain heightened, with President Donald Trump  reportedly scheduled to speak later on Friday . In the meantime, those hoping for a significant rebound in risk assets based on personal consumption data  may be disappointed  because anticipated soft readings could be overshadowed by tariff concerns and rising forward-looking inflation metrics. While the outlook may seem gloomy, more positive developments could occur once the macro dust settles. Notably, this week there was progress on the regulatory front, with the  SEC dropping charges against Uniswap , one of the leading decentralized exchanges, and mulling the same regarding its issues with  Consensys .

The ""breakout and retest play"" phenomenon is well-known across asset classes. Bitcoin's (BTC) ongoing sell-off might be just that – a healthy retest of the breakout point or the former resistance-turned-support of $73,757 breached in November. In other words, the downward momentum could run out of steam at or closer to these levels, potentially setting the stage for a bigger run higher. BTC's weekly chart: Breakout and retest play. (CoinDesk/Omkar)   BTC has dropped over 15% to under $80,000 this month, exposing the former resistance-turned-support at $73,757. Prices broke above that level in early November, ending months-long consolidation after pro-crypto Donald Trump won the U.S. Presidential election. The tendency of markets to retrace or revisit the breakout point before staging more enormous rallies has its roots in the behavioral aspects of investing. People are generally risk averse when it comes to securing gains. So, when facing profits, traders quickly book those instead of allowing the winning trade to run wild. The so-called  prospect theory  explains why post-breakout rallies abruptly run out of steam, often leading to a retest of the breakout point. BTC holders have been taking profits around the $100K mark since December. Now, as prices turn lower and near the breakout point, in this case, $73,757, market participants who missed the initial rally jump in, ensuring the level holds. The resulting bounce from the former resistance-turned-support draws in more and more buyers, potentially yielding a bigger rally. That's precisely what happened in the third quarter of 2023 and August-September 2020.  BTC: Breakout and retest from 2020 and 2023. (TradingView/CoinDesk)   On both occasions, the breakout and retest produced bigger rallies to new record highs. Traders, however, need to note that a failed retest or a lack of a meaningful bounce indicates underlying weakness that can evolve into a full blown downtrend.  Over the years, I have seen numerous examples of retests of breakouts/breakdowns leading to bigger moves in traditional markets.  Consider the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond. It triggered a double-bottom breakout in January 2024 and revisited the breakout level multiple times before rising to multi-year highs. Yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond.

Overall market capitalization fell 8% to $2.7 trillion, reversing all advances since U.S. President Donald Trump was elected in early November. The broad-based  CoinDesk 20 (CD20)  dropped nearly 9%. A solid earnings from Nvidia on Wednesday was not enough to offset the onsetting market gloom as global equities faltered on a combination of renewed tariff concerns, a slowing economy and overstretched positioning, which has naturally spilled over to crypto given BTC's high correlation with the S&P 500 index, traders say. “On a YTD basis, ex-BTC tokens and trading sentiment have struggled mightily with liquidity being depleted from the numerous memecoin runs, and BTC also buckled from the weight of ETF selling, which hit a record high last week,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. Friday’s losses in crypto markets mirrored those of Chinese stocks, which slumped after Trump announced a new 10% tariff on Chinese imports. This added to worries about a growing trade war between the U.S. and China, the world’s two largest economies. The new tariff adds to an existing 10% tax on Chinese goods that started earlier this month. This could hurt China’s economy, which faces a property crisis and falling prices. It might also stop a stock market rise fueled by China’s AI advances — led by ChatGPT rival DeepSeek. The move comes ahead of China’s big annual meeting, the National People’s Congress, starting next week, where leaders are expected to share economic plans and growth goals. A decision of China to spend more or encourage buying to boost the economy could impact bitcoin and crypto prices and serve as a market catalyst — making it a key data point to watch for next week. However, the mood remains bearish among some bitcoin traders until then. “Bullish option speculators are throwing in the towel as well, with volatility coming lower against a lower spot price as calls are being dumped in favour of puts,” SignalPlus’ Fan said. “Finally, concerns over MSTR (-10%) are adding an extra element of risk to BTC, given their convertible funded buying, putting bearish sentiment at a near-term extreme on many technical indicators.”",6:54,6:54,en,20250228," XRP, DOGE PRICE NEWS: Ripple, Dogecoin Tokens Slump 10% as New Trump Tariffs Hit Asia",6:54,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/02/28/xrp-doge-plunge-10-as-fresh-trump-tariffs-hit-china-markets," XRP, DOGE PRICE NEWS: Ripple, Dogecoin Tokens Slump 10% as New Trump Tariffs Hit Asia",CoinDesk,"bitcoin,xrp,dogecoin",article_page,shaurya-malwa,metered

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Protocol Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . Part of Metamask's revamped roadmap includes adding  smart contract capabilities  to its current wallet. At the moment, MetaMask is an Externally Owned Account (EOA), a type of wallet that is controlled by a public and a private key. One of the main downfalls with EOAs is that it is subject to human error, meaning if you forget your private key, you lose your crypto holdings in that account forever. The other type of wallet that exists on Ethereum are Contract Accounts (CAs), which are controlled by code and have recovery mechanisms in place and security checks for verifying transactions. In a blog post shared during ETHDenver, the largest North American Ethereum conference, the MetaMask team said “smart-contract-based accounts allow us to solve a number of problems: allowing new powerful uses of the assets you hold, while simultaneously improving security. When the user defines their terms from their own programmable account, we greatly expand how the user expresses their agency in ways that are enforced by their own code.” One of those new features aimed at making the user experience on MetaMask easier include ERC-5792, which builds on its current feature,  smart transactions . Under ERC-5792, or known as batched transactions, users can combine certain steps when it comes to signing off transactions, like “approve + swap” in one click, meaning that they would save time and gas fees by batching those steps together. Dan Finlay, the co-founder of MetaMask, told CoinDesk that batching transactions “give us all the things you're going to ask for in order, we'll present them to the user in a nice, unified way. The user will pay for one gas fee for the series of events and then it'll just be one block for the whole series of operations.” MetaMask card The MetaMask team also shared that  its MetaMask debit card  will be available in select states in the U.S. starting mid-March. The card has been in production for a few months and was initially available just to users in the UK and EU. It connects to a user’s MetaMask wallet, letting them spend their crypto. “You can be earning staking rewards or yield on your favorite protocol with your favorite tokens and have those funds available to spend anywhere that Mastercard is accepted with just a tap,” the team wrote in a blogpost. More support As part of the theme of making the user-experience easier, the MetaMask team will be adding support for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) in its wallets, meaning users can hold their various crypto assets in one place. “So these are simultaneously delivering some of the most popular blockchains, but, but they're also ensuring that we have smoothed out every part of our interface that allows new blockchains to be added seamlessly,” Finlay said in the interview.

There’s a direct line from the  efficient markets theory  of Eugene Fama in the 1960s to modern portfolio theory. It paved the way for index funds, a strategy that has not only weathered market cycles but also become the default for managing pensions and retirement accounts. As we step into a new era of digital finance, tokenized assets may offer a way to broaden our investment horizons in ways that traditional models have overlooked.

See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . The genesis of modern portfolio theory Index fund investing didn’t arise by chance. In the early 1970s, amid vigorous debates over market efficiency, Burton Malkiel’s seminal work advocating index funds in 1973 (in his book  “A Random Walk Down Wall Street” ) was embodied in John Bogle’s launch of the Vanguard S&P 500 fund in 1975. This cemented a strategy that focused on broad diversification and minimal trading. Astonishingly, passive index-investing has triumphed around the world, even though the theory underpinning it, that investors are always rational, hasn’t held up well. Behavioral psychologists like Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky illuminated the flaws in our decision-making processes. This is highlighted in Daniel Kahneman’s award winning book,  “Thinking Fast and Slow.” In the ensuing decades, economists have reconciled efficient markets and irrational behavior into the concept of “pretty good markets.” Aggregated wisdom in the form of prices trends towards being right, over time, though from day to day and case to case there are significant gaps that investors can exploit. Index funds have held up well because exploiting those opportunities is hard to do consistently or cheaply. At the same time, the regulatory framework governing institutional investing reinforces this reliance on proven strategies. Fund managers operate under strict fiduciary duties that require them to prioritize client interests and mitigate risk. As a result, they allocate the bulk of their portfolios to assets with long, established track records, typically government bonds and passive equity funds. In short, the criteria for “acceptable” investments aren’t driven solely by potential returns; they are fundamentally tied to data history, reliability, and transparency. In case you were wondering, that means index funds. In this environment, venturing into uncharted territory is not taken lightly. New asset classes, no matter how promising, are initially sidelined because they lack the long-term, daily data that makes them viable for inclusion in a fiduciary portfolio. Until now, almost all portfolio theory has been based on U.S. equities and government bonds. Although that universe has expanded over time to include index funds and bonds from other large economies, it still represents only a relatively small portion of the world’s assets. Portfolios are constrained at the intersection of regulations and data. And that’s all going to change. Tokenization: Expanding the universe of investable assets Tokenization and on-chain transactions don’t just offer a scalable way to package any kind of asset. They also offer a path to transparent, comparable data on asset values. By representing real-world assets, whether it’s Thai real estate, Nigerian oil leases, or New York taxi medallions as digital tokens on a blockchain, we can begin to generate the kind of daily, market-derived data that has traditionally been reserved for a narrow set of assets. Consider a simple question: How much Thai real estate should feature in a diversified retirement portfolio? Under current models, the answer is obscured by a lack of reliable, continuous pricing data. But if Thai real estate were tokenized, establishing an on-chain market with daily closing prices, it could eventually be measured against the same metrics used for U.S. equities. In time, this would force a re-examination of the static, index-based approach that has dominated investment strategy for so long. The implications for global finance Right now, alternative strategies – as pension fund managers refer to anything that isn’t a stock or bond index – comprise no more than 15–20% of most funds. Changing academic data on investment options would put the other 80% up for grabs. Imagine a future where a truly diversified portfolio isn’t limited by the confines of traditional equity and debt markets. With tokenization, investors from large institutional funds to individual savers could gain exposure to asset classes and geographic regions previously ignored due to data scarcity or illiquidity. The principles that underpin modern portfolio theory wouldn’t be discarded. Rather, they would be expanded upon to include a broader range of risk and return profiles. As tokenized assets build track records, fiduciaries, who today favor the predictability of bonds and index funds, might find themselves compelled to recalibrate their strategies. It’s not that the pretty good market hypothesis will be rendered obsolete. Instead, the parameters of what constitutes “efficient” may widen considerably. A richer dataset could lead to better-informed risk assessments and, ultimately, to portfolios that capture a more accurate picture of global value. A Measured but inevitable shift This isn’t going to happen overnight. The fastest we’re likely to see changes emerge is about a decade, assuming time to build a wide portfolio of tokenized assets and 5-7 years to build a daily information track record. Once the data is present, however, change could come quickly, thanks to widespread use of artificial intelligence. One thing that often slows the spread of change is a lack of intellectual bandwidth on the part of fund managers and consumers to adapt to new data. It took about 40 years to move pension fund investors from a 95%+ bonds model in the 1950s to a majority equity index fund model in the 1990s. It took about 30 years for index funds to become the dominant equity investment vehicle after the evidence showed they were the best option. In a world of AI-driven automated investment tools, the transition might happen a whole lot faster. And with hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets under management, every percentage point change in allocation strategy is a little tsunami of change by itself. We’ll also be hosting a free session on the place digital assets will have in portfolios at the  upcoming EY Global Blockchain Summit, 1 -3 April .

The federal securities regulator said that memecoins — which it defined as a “type of crypto asset inspired by internet memes, characters, current events or trends for which the promoter seeks to attract an enthusiastic online community to purchase the memecoin and engage in its trading” — are more like collectibles than securities, according to a  staff statement  from the SEC’s corporate finance division published on Thursday. Because memecoins have “limited or no use or functionality,” they do not meet the definition of a security under the Howey Test and are therefore outside the SEC’s jurisdiction. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . The statement is a formalization of  comments made by Commissioner Hester Peirce  — the leader of the SEC’s newly-created Crypto Task Force, which has been at the vanguard of the agency’s about-face on crypto regulation since it was formed in January — earlier this month during an interview with Bloomberg TV. In the interview, Peirce said that “many” of the memecoins on the market fall outside the SEC’s jurisdiction. “If people want to buy a token or product that lacks a clear long-term value proposition, they should feel free but should not be surprised some day if the price drops,” Peirce wrote in her roadmap for crypto regulation published earlier this month. “In this country, people generally have a right to make decisions for themselves, but the counterpart to that wonderful American liberty is the equally wonderful American expectation that people must decide for themselves, not look to Mama Government to tell them what to do or not to do, nor to bail them out when they do something that turns out badly.” Such legal interpretations from the securities regulator don't have the weight of formal regulation, but industries overseen by the SEC and other federal regulators tend to follow these kinds of staff statements closely. The infamous Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 — guidance known as SAB 121 that was offered by agency accounting staffers — caused turmoil in the crypto sector and the bankers who felt constrained by it until the bulletin was erased by the SEC's current leadership. In this case, a footnote in the staff memecoin statement points out that it's ""not a rule, regulation, guidance, or statement"" approved by the commission. Though Peirce has made it clear that American investors are responsible for doing their own due diligence on the tokens they buy, the SEC has not ruled out the possibility of stepping in and using its enforcement powers in the case where memecoins are used to evade securities laws. “Notwithstanding the foregoing, this statement does not extend to the offer and sale of meme coins that are inconsistent with the descriptions set forth above, or products that are labeled “meme coins” in an effort to evade the application of the federal securities laws by disguising a product that otherwise would constitute a security,” the staff statement said. “As noted above, the Division will evaluate the economic realities of the particular transaction.”",22:45,22:45,en,20250227,SEC Publishes Memecoin Stance Reinforcing Hester Peirce’s Comments,22:45,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/02/27/sec-publishes-memecoin-stance-reinforcing-hester-peirce-s-comments,SEC Publishes Memecoin Stance Reinforcing Hester Peirce’s Comments,CoinDesk,"sec,meme-coin,hester-peirce",article_page,cheyenne-ligon,metered

If China already allows investors to buy U.S. stocks through its Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) program, why not bitcoin? The key, one expert argued on stage at Consensus Hong Kong, is control, and Beijing may have just found a way to keep it. In China, there are two systems for mainland investors to buy and sell stock outside the country. First, there’s QDII, which allows select investors to buy U.S. ETFs using RMB. Then there's also the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect, which let Chinese investors buy and sell Hong Kong stocks through mainland securities firms, with all trades settled in RMB. ""The key [with these systems] is that capital never flows freely out of China, and if you apply this same logic to crypto, there’s no reason it couldn’t work the same way,"" Yifan He, CEO of Red Date technology, said on stage at Consensus Hong Kong. He emphasized that the biggest regulatory hurdle isn’t crypto itself, but capital controls, ensuring that funds don’t move freely in and out of China. These capital controls are in place to prevent excessive currency fluctuations and capital flight, in order to maintain the stability and value of the RMB. They are also one of the reasons why  Hong Kong's crypto ETFs , with their in-kind redemptions, were not allowed on the mainland. ""What’s the difference between a Hong Kong-regulated stock and a Hong Kong-regulated crypto asset?"" He continued. ""If they have a system for you to buy and sell in RMB, but never move money outside China, then it's just another regulated investment product."" This system would not allow Chinese investors to self-custody their crypto. Instead, purchases would be held by an intermediary, such as a licensed securities firm. ""They buy crypto directly, but it’s not like they’re holding it themselves,"" He said, noting that ""the security company in the middle actually holds it for you."" This model aligns with China’s approach to stock and ETF investments. Just as mainland investors can trade U.S. ETFs through QDII but never take direct custody, they could gain exposure to crypto without owning the underlying assets – no money moves across borders. For a nation with 200 million retail investors and an economy in need of stimulus, regulated crypto access through Hong Kong's sandbox might offer Beijing a calculated compromise Blockchain versus Crypto China has long been a proponent of blockchain technology, while taking a cold approach to crypto. ""We don't allow guns in China, but we can still make steel,"" He explained as an analogy. ""The technology is not regulated so that you can build all kinds of applications. But when some application triggers regulations, that’s different."" But based on his conversations with financial regulators, this could be changing. ""I see some signal from financial regulators,"" He said. ""They're beginning to talk about bitcoin, saying we need to pay more attention and do more research on digital assets."" Could this lead to broader adoption? Two years ago, He would have said ‘zero chance.’ ""Now, I’d say there’s more than a 50% chance in three years,"" He concluded. And you can take those  odds to Polymarket , which currently stands at 2% chance of China unbanning bitcoin in the country.

Though the SEC's intention to agree to shut down the legal dispute had already gone public when the U.S. crypto exchange  announced the deal last week , the commissioners had to cast a formal vote to ask a federal judge to throw the switch. The dismissal —  opposed by the commission's sole Democrat , Caroline Crenshaw — was done in such a way that the regulator can't change its mind later. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.

""It’s time for the commission to rectify its approach and develop crypto policy in a more transparent manner,"" SEC Acting Chair Mark Uyeda said in a statement. SEC lawyers already  filed a motion  to dismiss the case. Dropping this main case doesn't free the SEC from other Coinbase legal matters, including the company's petition to force the agency to establish crypto rules and Coinbase's pursuit of internal documents in the exchange's ongoing work to reveal the regulator's private deliberations on how to approach digital assets. But this enforcement case was the top legal concern for the U.S. public company, and it sought to elevate the central legal questions of what makes a crypto security and when (and how) a digital assets exchange should register with the agency. Those fundamental questions still await answers that must now be provided by the U.S. Congress. Once the SEC's previous leadership departed — especially the crypto skeptic chair, Gary Gensler — the temporary chair elevated by President Donald Trump, Mark Uyeda, began overhauling the agency's legal officials and its stance on digital assets. Uyeda named fellow Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce to run the agency's crypto task force, and both of them were vocal critics of the way Gensler approached the industry. The digital assets sector didn't have to wait for the confirmation of Paul Atkins, Trump's pick to permanently run the agency.  Both Uyeda and Peirce served as his counsels when he was a commissioner at the SEC, so they're widely expected to be on a course he'll maintain. So far, that course has seen a wave of abandoned crypto investigations and dropped cases, including against Robinhood, Gemini and ConsenSys's MetaMask, and pauses of matters involving Tron and Binance. The regulator is no longer maintaining the interpretation of the U.S. Supreme Court's so-called Howey test that it said had indicated many crypto projects qualified as securities. ""Goodbye,"" Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal  posted on social-media site X  after the SEC's announcement on Thursday. ""And good riddance."" But Commissioner Crenshaw argued the wholesale withdrawals and dismissals of such cases undermines the authority of the enforcement division, suggesting it's ""politicized"" and serves at the whim of each new administration.  ""Whatever the law may be tomorrow, market participants should not be able to avoid the law as it stands today,"" Crenshaw said in her statement. ""Today’s action creates more uncertainty. What exactly is the law as it applies to crypto assets? How can we pursue fraudulent conduct in this space while casting doubt on our regulatory jurisdiction?"" The SEC's changed view on Coinbase, which CoinDesk was first to report on last week, will cause the exchange to shift its Washington focus toward Congress and legislation, Grewal told CoinDesk in a previous interview. The company is among the digital assets businesses that led the creation and deployment of the Fairshake PAC in the 2004 elections, collectively devoting more than $160 million to an effort to elect crypto-friendly candidates to office. Now Coinbase is seeking to get a return on that investment with regulations that it considers favorable. The Fairshake PAC, which shook up the campaign-finance world with its outsized corporate spending levels, is still at it, dabbling in special elections as it prepares for the 2026 cycle.

That discourse isn’t as prevalent when it comes to Proof-of-Stake networks like Ethereum and Solana, but staking firm SenseiNode aims to make such blockchains as resilient as possible by spinning up validator infrastructure in Latin America. “When we started, 99% of nodes were located in Europe, the US and some in Asia,” SenseiNode CEO Pablo Larguia told CoinDesk in an interview. “We were the first to bring geographic and jurisdictional decentralization to Latin America.” With roughly $800 million worth of assets  staked  through its platform, SenseiNode is the 15th largest staking firm globally. The largest of them, Kiln, manages over $7 billion. SenseiNode operates in various Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica and Colombia. It also has nodes set up in the U.S. and Germany. The common point in all of these jurisdictions is that SenseiNode uses local and regional data centers. “Most of the nodes in the US and Europe are hosted in Amazon Web Services. At the end of the day, that’s a point of centralization,” Larguia said. Data centers in Latin America usually aren’t as advanced as Western ones, however, which has forced SenseiNode to take on an educational role in some cases and help build the necessary infrastructure to run staking services. Read more:  Staked Ether Is Creating a Benchmark for the Crypto Economy, Says ARK Invest Requirements for running nodes vary from protocol to protocol, Larguia said. For example, some projects may have larger storage requirements if their blockchain history is older. Node costs also differ.

However, there are no limits to how many tokens you can delegate to a single Solana validator, contrary to Ethereum validators, which are limited to 32 ETH each. Ethereum staking is therefore more expensive to handle for SenseiNode than Solana staking. “For Polkadot and Avalanche, we have like two or three nodes, but for Ethereum we have like 9,000,” Larguia said.",20:41,20:41,en,20250227,How SenseiNode Is Building Proof-of-Stake Infrastructure in Latin America,20:41,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/02/27/how-senseinode-is-building-proof-of-stake-infrastructure-in-latin-america,How SenseiNode Is Building Proof-of-Stake Infrastructure in Latin America,CoinDesk,"staking,latin-american,ethereum,solana",article_page,tom-carreras,metered

The U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump have made noise about a federal strategic digital assets reserve, with the idea's public campaign stemming from the Bitcoin 2024 stage in Nashville, Tennessee, back before Trump won his election and Republicans rose to the majorities in Congress. Trump has spoken broadly in favor of the notion, which has also been more aggressively  advocated by MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor  and  pitched by Senator Cynthia Lummis , the Wyoming Republican who helms the crypto subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee. Many of the states raced to beat the feds to the punch, but in the weeks that have marked this trend, the market value of the asset most of the efforts are talking about — bitcoin ( BTC ) — has slipped considerably from the post-election euphoria that seemed to spur enthusiasm. Read More:  U.S. Bitcoin Reserve May Be Coming, But States Are Winning the Race The drop in price to about $83,000 from a Trump inauguration-day high of $106,000 has been coupled with  another high-profile exchange hack  at Bybit that reportedly made off with more crypto than thieves have ever previously snatched in one outing. These setbacks may have further dampened the goodwill of state-government enthusiasts. ""That sense of urgency appears to have abated now,"" said Johnny Garcia, a managing director at VeChain Foundation who has been following the state actions. ""My view is states have some breathing room to assess and to contemplate a way forward."" Montana  and  North Dakota  saw clear losses when their legislatures considered the idea of state-level crypto reserves. Both legislatures voted to reject the bills. The other three states where the initiatives failed saw those rejections happen at the committee level. Meanwhile, Utah's legislation to allow the crypto investment of up to 5% of certain public accounts has cleared the state house and a senate committee on its way to  consideration by the entire senate  there. But getting that vote is never a certainty in the limited windows most states give to their legislative activity. ""Although Utah seems best positioned to finalize its bill first, nothing is guaranteed,"" said Dennis Porter, CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund that's pushed for states to  embrace bitcoin reserves . ""It's a dynamic process."" Porter said the campaign in the states is leaning on them as the ""laboratory of democracy."" He posted on social-media site X (formerly Twitter) that  most of the bills will fail , which is ""normal"" for the process, which his group will continue pursuing each year. Texas, a major bitcoin mining hub, reportedly became the latest state legislature to move a  crypto reserve bill  out of committee. But the states have pursued such a wide variety of digital assets initiatives that they're difficult to pin down as a common effort. And some states are moving on other aspects of crypto involvement, such as Indiana's house-passed bill weighing blockchain for government efficiency and Arizona  advancing a technical bill through its house  that would keep unclaimed property in crypto form, rather than converting it to cash — an outcome that would involve managing it in a state fund. While North Dakota's effort to set up a reserve failed, the state house also approved a separate resolution that encourages its treasurer to  invest certain state funds in digital assets . That resolution is now in the hands of the state senate. Garcia predicted that ""many of these states will likely authorize digital assets as part of their state pension and investment options before moving toward more aggressive digital asset reserves.""",18:29,18:31,en,20250227,"Utah One Vote Away, But Some States Fail to Break Through on Crypto Stakes",18:29,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/02/27/utah-one-vote-away-but-some-states-fail-to-break-through-on-crypto-stakes,"Utah One Vote Away, But Some States Fail to Break Through on Crypto Stakes",CoinDesk,"regulation,state-legislature,utah,texas,bitcoin-strategic-reserve,donald-trump",article_page,jesse-hamilton,metered

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . Joe Lubin, CEO of Brooklyn-based crypto software company ConsenSys, said in a Thursday  X post  that the SEC has agreed to drop its ongoing securities enforcement case against ConsenSys’s MetaMask wallet tool. Like the agency’s decision to  drop its case against crypto exchange Coinbase , which was announced last week, the move must first be approved by the agency’s commissioners. “We were committed to fighting this suit until the bitter end but welcome this outcome. No company wants to be the target of agency enforcement, but at the same time, it was our duty and honor to stand up for blockchain software developers in the hour it was most needed, as I’m sure our industry peers who also stood up against regulatory overreach would tell you,” Lubin wrote. The SEC  sued ConsenSys over MetaMask last June , alleging that the popular wallet tool was an unregistered securities broker that “engaged in the offer and sale of securities.” The suit came approximately two weeks after the SEC informed ConsenSys that it would close its probe into Ethereum 2.0, which ConsenSys had previously sued the regulator over in April 2024, citing regulatory overreach. The SEC’s decision to drop its enforcement suit against ConsenSys is the latest in a string of dropped cases and investigations into crypto companies, including Gemini, Robinhood Crypto, Uniswap Labs, OpenSea and Coinbase. It's also asked courts to pause ongoing cases against Binance and the Tron Foundation, as well as their affiliated companies and executives. The agency is currently overhauling its approach to crypto regulation under the new leadership of Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, who created a Crypto Task Force – spearheaded by crypto-friendly Commissioner Hester Peirce – just one day after Gensler’s departure. In a statement earlier this month,  Peirce laid out the SEC’s roadmap  for crypto regulation, and urged companies to be patient as the agency figured out how to “disentangle” itself from ongoing litigation. “We appreciate the SEC’s new leadership and the pro-innovation, pro-investor path they are taking,” Lubin wrote. “We will remain deeply engaged with public and private policymakers going forward. Crypto wants the U.S. to address the best interests of consumers and businesses alike, and we are already on our way to making that happen.” The SEC declined to comment.",18:11,18:11,en,20250227,"SEC Plans to Drop Enforcement Suit Against ConsenSys’ MetaMask, CEO Joe Lubin Says",18:11,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/02/27/sec-plans-to-drop-enforcement-suit-against-consensys-metamask-ceo-joe-lubin-says,"SEC Plans to Drop Enforcement Suit Against ConsenSys’ MetaMask, CEO Joe Lubin Says",CoinDesk,"consensys,joe-lubin,metamask,sec",article_page,cheyenne-ligon,metered

Flynet is a layer-3 blockchain based on top of  Coinbase's Base chain . Base, a  layer-2 network , allows users to transact on top of Ethereum for faster and cheaper. The team claims that having a layer-3 benefits the restaurant industry, because “by handling payments and loyalty programs entirely on Flynet, Blackbird eliminates traditional middlemen, reduces transaction costs, and introduces a new model for rewarding both diners and partners.” Blackbird had  previously released a payments platform , letting users pay for their meals with $FLY, the platform’s native token, which users could earn through the programs loyalty program by dining at participating restaurants, or by purchasing it in the Blackbird app using the USDC stablecoin. With Flynet live, $FLY will be used in the same way, but now restaurants can use the token to pay platform fees as well. In addition, the team is releasing a new token, $F2, to be used for gas fees on the network. The team said that they will airdrop 13% of the $F2 token supply to early users and restaurants, with distribution depending on certain activity metrics. The remaining 87% of $F2 will go to “insiders, the treasury, and we have another six seasons after this that we will allocate tokens to the participants,” Leventhal told CoinDesk in an interview. According to the team, Blackbird has $85 million in funding with backers from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Coinbase, Spark Capital, and American Express. In 2023, a16z  raised more than $24 million  for the platform in a Series A round. Blackbird currently is available in New York, San Francisco and Charleston, and lets diners earn rewards at some of their favorite restaurants. Leventhal told CoinDesk there are roughly 500 restaurants as part of their loyalty program. “What we think we can do is build something where transactions become much more cost effective, and the levers that restaurants have to attract and retain customers will become vast,” Leventhal told CoinDesk on how he sees the restaurant industry and blockchain intersecting. “And those two things, more than anything else, is the reason why we're building on-chain.” Read more:  Blackbird, Web3 Startup From Resy Co-Founder, Wants Diners to Pay for Meals in Crypto",17:00,17:00,en,20250227,"Blackbird, Blockchain Restaurant Loyalty App, Goes Live With Flynet Mainnet",17:00,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/02/26/blackbird-blockchain-restaurant-loyalty-app-goes-live-with-flynet-mainnet,"Blackbird, Blockchain Restaurant Loyalty App, Goes Live With Flynet Mainnet",CoinDesk,"base,layer-3,restaurants,on-chain",article_page,margaux-nijkerk,metered

See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . “We’re not at a point where AI agents can do everything,” David Minarsch, a founding member of Olas, said in an interview. “In order to architect the systems, it's better if you separate concerns. So you let different agents specialize in different things, and that specialization gives rise to the need for agents to trade with each other.” For example, if you’re using an AI agent to make money from prediction markets, the agent would typically know how to interact with the betting platform — how to place orders, how to withdraw funds — but it may need help from a different AI agent to make the actual predictions. AI agents can already interact with each other; Olas has recorded more than four million transactions within its ecosystem, and more than half between agents. The difference, Minarsch said, is that AI agents can currently find other agents only by having their specific identities coded in. The marketplace, then, makes things more dynamic; instead of being programmed to interact with specific bots, AI agents can now simply come to the Mech Marketplace and find whatever they need. Olas is supported by a variety of blockchains: Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and Gnosis Chain, with the vast majority of transactions occurring on this last chain. Almost 2,000 AI agents have already been deployed across Olas’ ecosystem, about 500 of which are active on a daily basis. The firm recently  raised $13.8 million  to help it launch Pearl, an app store that allows users to own AI agents. Down the line, AI agents will likely be able to abstract away some of crypto’s complexities, Minarsch said. Instead of manually seeding wallets, bridging networks, and managing DeFi yield vaults, users will simply be able to tell the agent what to do for them. “We will find ourselves in a situation where every human will have multiple agents augmenting their daily lives and fully autonomously doing things for them,” Minarsch said.

Subscribe here  to get it every Thursday. DeFi Renaissance - Why 2025 Will Be The Year of Decentralized And On-Chain Finance? The  recent hack of ByBit  for nearly 401.000 ETH, valued at about $1.5 billion at that time, exposed that security will play a tremendous role in further crypto adoption. Can institutions expand on-chain after such an incident? Undoubtedly. It’s a matter of gradual adoption alongside ensuring top-notch security procedures. Growing Adoption of Yield-Bearing Assets: Staking, Liquid Staking, Restaking and Liquid Restaking In traditional finance, yield-generating assets are typically seen as stronger long-term investments than non-productive ones since they provide investors with ongoing cash flow and income. This perspective helps explain why some investors prefer ether over bitcoin. Ether is seen as more “productive” because it powers a network supporting a wide range of decentralized applications, benefiting from network effects. Beyond that, ether can be staked to earn consistent yield, aligning well with traditional valuation methods that prioritize ongoing dividends. The rising interest in staking, especially in the context of yield-generating assets, is evident in the growth of liquid staking, which enables frictionless and capital-efficient staking. This trend accelerated further in 2024 with the emergence of liquid restaking — for instance,  ether.fi , a leading liquid restaking platform, saw explosive growth last year, with over $8 billion worth of ether staked through its rails. Source: DeFi Llama, Total Value Locked in Ether.Fi The total amount of staked ether is expected to grow and play a significant role in DeFi. Around one-third of all ETH — or $90 billion — is staked, with further inflows anticipated from traditional financial institutions exploring staking. As staking becomes more accessible through FinTech applications, some investors may transition from custodial to non-custodial solutions as they gain a deeper understanding of blockchain technology. Stablecoin Growth Global demand for U.S. dollar exposure is immense, and stablecoins are the most efficient way to meet it. Stablecoins like USDC expand access to dollar-denominated wealth preservation and streamline value exchange. In 2024, venture capital investments have flowed into stablecoin projects, and we anticipate further development in this space. Regulatory frameworks like the EU’s MiCA have provided more explicit guidelines, further legitimizing stablecoins and likely driving higher adoption next year. Additionally, stablecoins are being integrated into traditional financial systems. For example, Visa has begun using USDC on networks like Solana to facilitate faster and more efficient payments. Additionally, PayPal entered the market with PUSD, and Stripe made one of crypto’s most significant acquisitions by purchasing Bridge to expand its stablecoin operations. In 2024, the total stablecoin market capitalization reached an all-time high,  exceeding $200 billion dollars,  and continuing to set new records in 2025. Source: DeFi Llama, Total Stablecoins Market Cap Enhanced Interoperability and User-Friendly Non-Custodial Solutions A key challenge in DeFi is moving funds across networks to access different investments. By 2025, significant progress is anticipated toward eliminating the necessity of bridging funds by introducing a ""one-click solution."" This development should simplify the process for new DeFi users, likely attracting more participants to the space. Additionally, wallet providers are expected to improve the security of on-chain finance and streamline the onboarding process by eliminating cumbersome crypto-native setups. This shift, driven by innovations like the  Account Abstraction movement , aims to make crypto more accessible and user-friendly for accessing on-chain finance. Currently, the irreversible nature of transactions and the prevalence of sophisticated scams deter many new users. However, improved security features should encourage more individuals to engage with decentralized finance. Bitcoin Reaching $100K While simply holding bitcoin on its native network isn’t inherently linked to on-chain finance, we’re witnessing a growing integration of bitcoin with decentralized financial ecosystems. For example, roughly 0.5% of bitcoin’s total supply through staking protocol Babylon is now locked to secure Proof-of-Stake (POS) chains. The increased acceptance of bitcoin by large banks and some governments is anticipated to create trickle-down effects, changing the public’s perception of digital currencies away from being seen purely as a speculative asset or illicit activities toward being a legitimate financial instrument, bringing new users on-chain. - Marcin Kaźmierczak, COO, Redstone Oracles Ask an Expert Q: Can banks hold crypto with SEC’s SAB 122? A:   SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 122  may encourage banks to integrate digital assets into the regulated financial system. By opening competition, banks can compete with centralized exchanges. Banks can offer services like bitcoin-backed lending, staking and custodial services, which treat digital assets more like traditional assets. This is a positive move into a more flexible regulatory approach and balancing investor protections with the operational realities of financial institutions. From institutional investment to mainstream recognition, this is another major shift in how the world views and interacts with digital assets. Q: Which Institutions (e.g. sovereign wealth funds, pensions, companies, etc.) are buying bitcoin? A:  The accumulation by sovereign wealth funds, and pension funds is just getting started. Mubadala Investment Company PJSC (the wealth fund owned by the government of Abu Dhabi) holds $436 million in one bitcoin ETF with overall assets under management of $302 billion. Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund (AIDA) manages a combined $1.7 trillion, indicating that their bitcoin investment is a relatively small portion of the overall portfolio. Additionally, this past fall,  Mubadala offered to acquire  Canadian asset management firm CI Financial Corp. for $4.6 billion. In the U.S., the State of Wisconsin Investment Board’s latest report shows its bitcoin ETF holdings have more than doubled from last quarter to over $321 million. Q: Banking on bitcoin – Which Canadian bank is leading the charge? A:  Recent Q4 2024  SEC filings  reveal that Canadian Schedule 1 banks, institutional money managers, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds have disclosed significant bitcoin holdings (see charts). Notably, Bank of Montreal now tops Canadian banks with $139 million in spot bitcoin ETF investments. And BMO’s bitcoin holdings went from zero to over $100 million in a single year. Currently, in North America, there are approximately 1,623 large entities holding over $25.8 billion in bitcoin ETPs. - Kevin Tam, digital asset research specialist Keep Reading Citadel  announced plans  to offer crypto trading and liquidity.

The London-based company acted as a broker and also an underwriter using its own syndicate and capital pool on  Nexus Mutual , a decentralized insurance alternative that  backed Native  in October of last year. The cover protects against smart-contract hacks leading to the loss of Bittensor tokens ( TAO ) used to validate the network’s  proof of stake  (PoS) consensus mechanism.

Hacks are a persistent worry in the crypto ecosystem, where insurance cover remains thin on the ground, particularly in more experimental and esoteric realms like staking or  decentralized finance  (DeFi). Last week, Bybit, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges,  lost $1.5 billion  to North Korea-linked hackers. Nexus Mutual arrived in 2019 with an  alternative form of insurance  cover for the emerging DeFi sector, incentivizing a community of members to deploy assets into blockchain-based syndicates, similar in some ways to how the Lloyd’s of London insurance market allows syndicates of investors to back risks. Native, which runs one of the larger capital pools on Nexus Mutual, also acts in a more traditional broker role providing access to Lloyd’s for certain types of crypto-related insurance cover. The striking thing about the Rizzo validator risk on Bittensor was the speed with which Native arranged the cover, which took just four weeks, Native co-founder Dan Ross said in an interview. “This is the first time Bittensor has been underwritten,” Ross said. “Team Rizzo wanted to buy their own policy to attract people to come and stake to their own validator and make them feel safe. So we've been able to create a new product, underwrite a new protocol, get third party smart-contract cover with a $25 million limit in about four weeks. If we did that with traditional insurance, that's a three to six month thing at minimum — if it could be done at all.” The Bittensor policy will be followed by cover for bitcoin staking platform  Babylon  in the coming weeks, Ross added. “Team Rizzo has played the long game to become one of — if not the most — consistent and performant validators on Bittensor,” said Bittensor founder Jake Steeves in a statement.",14:00,14:00,en,20250227,Bittensor App Gets Hack Risk Cover From Nexus Mutual-Backed Insurance Firm Native,14:00,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/02/27/bittensor-gets-hack-risk-cover-from-nexus-mutual-backed-insurance-firm-native,Bittensor App Gets Hack Risk Cover From Nexus Mutual-Backed Insurance Firm Native,CoinDesk,"exclusive,insurance,ai,nexus-mutual,defi",article_page,ian-allison,metered

",12:51,News,20250227,0f6355b1-b4f3-4df2-ac54-99e17ef09a31,20250227,"Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped 10% to $86,300 this week, diving out of a prolonged period of trading between $90,000 and $110,000. The so-called bearish range breakdown has traders closely examining charts for clues about where the sell-off may drive prices next. One of the key levels under scrutiny is the ""runaway gap"" in CME bitcoin futures below $80,000, which formed three months ago. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.

A gap is a blank space on a price chart between the closing or high price on a specific day and the next opening price, signifying that there was no trading activity at prices in between. When the gap appears in an established trend, it's called a runaway or continuation gap. Unlike bitcoin's spot market, which is open 24/7, CME bitcoin futures trade 23 hours a day Sunday through Friday. The market opens at 5 p.m. CT (23:00 UTC) and closes for an hour's maintenance the next day at 4 p.m.  As the bitcoin rally picked up steam following President Donald Trump's Nov. 4 election victory, a runaway gap appeared in the CME futures on the following day. Prices opened the next day at $81,210, significantly above the election-day high of $77,930. It's widely held that price gaps are eventually filled, with traders buying and selling the asset in the previously non-traded zone. The process is often seen as a natural market behavior, reflecting a return to equilibrium. ""Historically, CME gaps are filled eventually, and it is usually hard to say when,"" Nicolai Sondergaard, a research analyst at Nansen, said in a Telegram message. ""The recent unexpected events are the larger reasons for why we have seen these big downwards movements and without them I think we wouldn't really be looking at the CME gap.""  The risk indicators at Nansen have recently ""gone risk-off,"" so it wouldn't be surprising if the CME gap is filled, Sondergaard said Technical analysis theory, however, suggests otherwise. It says that common gaps, which often occur during regular trading, and exhaustion gaps, which appear during trend reversals, are typically filled quickly. In contrast, the likelihood of runaway gaps being filled is relatively low. It's worth noting that a gap has formed between Feb. 24 and Feb. 25 as prices dropped out of the prolonged consolidation. Which of these gaps will be filled first remains uncertain.

Which applies in today's market, the day after the largest cryptocurrency posted its  steepest three-day decline  since the collapse of FTX in 2022? The drop left BTC 25% below January's all-time high, despite the advent of President Donald Trump's pro-crypto administration. It's no surprise the  largest hack in crypto history  has shaken investor sentiment. Add to that the  memecoin frenzy , which pulled liquidity out of the broader market.  That said, in previous cycles so-called bull-market corrections have sent bitcoin tumbling as much as 35%. Given that BTC hasn't had a meaningful pullback since the yen carry trade unwind last August, the current situation is almost normal. CoinDesk research  showed that bitcoin was trading in an extremely tight range for a meaningful period, and a break in the channel was inevitable. On-chain data tells us that bitcoin recently bounced off its 200-day-moving average or roughly $81,800. While short-term holders are selling — panic sales, perhaps? — at the highest level since August, because they have held BTC for 155 days or less they are usually seen as a signal of some form of capitulation in the market. BlackRock's IBIT saw  record outflows  on Wednesday. However, it's not all bad news.

The platform hit a peak in October 2024, creating over 36,000 tokens in a day and generating a record $3 billion market cap for its ecosystem, but activity has since plummeted, with daily token launches dropping more than 60%. Data from Dune Analytics shows Pump.fun's token graduation rate remains low at around 1%-2%, with many tokens failing to sustain value post-launch, contributing to the downturn. The decline comes as Solana's SOL has dropped more than 40% since the start of the year.

That's a sign of traders hedging downside risks. SOL and LTC have also seen increases in open interest, but with positive funding rates.

The illicit actors are converting some of their stolen assets to bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies ""across thousands of addresses on multiple blockchains,"" the PSA said. The FBI said it expects the assets to be laundered further and eventually converted to fiat currency.

The sell-off is  consistent with CoinDesk's analysis  earlier this month, which noted investor disappointment over the lack of swift action from President Donald Trump's administration on creating the promised national BTC reserve and tightening fiat liquidity conditions. Institutional demand for the largest cryptocurrency and its second-largest peer, ether (ETH),  weakened , pushing the CME futures market closer to backwardation, a market condition where spot prices are higher than prices for futures.  Additionally, Nasdaq, the Wall Street's tech-heavy index, has also come under pressure, adding to BTC's woes. BTC's three-day candlestick chart. (TradingView/CoinDesk)   The question now is, what next? The path of least resistance appears to be on the downside, as the Trump tariffs story could heat up again as the March 4 deadline for tariffs against Canada and Mexico nears. The first shots fired early this month had led to a broad-based risk-off mood. Bulls shouldn't pin their hopes on Friday's core PCE  Those pinning hopes on Friday's U.S. ""core"" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, to put a floor under risk assets might face disappointment, according to Noelle Acheson, author of the "" Crypto is Macro Now "" newsletter. The core PCE, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, is expected to have risen 2.6% year-on-year in January, down from December's 2.8%, according to FactSet's consensus estimates  quoted by Morningstar . Typically, slower inflation is associated with a greater probability of Fed rate cuts and risk-on. However, this time markets could look past the expected soft reading and focus on the ongoing uptick in the forward-looking inflation metrics. For instance, the Conference Board's consumer confidence for February released this week showed a surge in one-year inflation expectations to 6% from 5.2%. That's quite a jump. The two- and five-year inflation swaps have also been rising,  as CoinDesk noted  earlier this month. Per Acheson, markets may see the expected decline in the core PCE as a sign of economic weakness. ""Anyway, even if the PCE comes in softer than forecast, it could be taken as confirmation of slowing growth, sending markets into another whirlwind of concern,"" Acheson said in Wednesday's edition of the newsletter shared with CoinDesk. ""So, this bad mood is largely macro-driven,"" Acheson added, expressing concerns over tariffs, high corporate valuations and overexposure of portfolios to AI. Acheson, however, said crypto could soon find its footing, thanks to bitcoin's dual appeal as a risk asset and a haven akin to digital gold. ""For most portfolios, the risk-asset/safe haven duality suggests that there is a price at which new longer-term investors will start to come in – this encourages traders to come back in, also,"" Acheson noted. Potential support levels/demand zones Per technical analysis theory, a downside break of a prolonged range play, as seen in BTC, usually leads to a notable drop, equivalent to the breadth of the range. In other words, the downside break of the $90K-$110K range means a potential for a slide to $70,000. ""In a worst-case scenario, Bitcoin could drop to the $72,000–$74,000 range, where a rebound will likely occur,"" Markus Thielen, founder of  10x Research , said in a note to clients Wednesday, noting bitcoin's lagged correlation to the global central bank liquidity indicator. BTC's lagged positive relationship with the global liquidity indicator. (10x Research)   That said, BTC has bounced to $86,000 at press time, having tested a supposed demand zone at around $82,000, suggested by Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, in Wednesday's client note. Thielen identified the $82,000 level by analyzing an on-chain metric called the short-term holders' realized price – the average price at which addresses holding coins for less than 155 days have purchased their BTC – suggests the potential demand zone is around $82,000. ""Historically, bitcoin rarely trades below this (short-term holders' realized price] level in bull markets for extended periods, whereas, in bear markets, it tends to stay below it for longer durations. During the summer 2024 consolidation, bitcoin dropped $9,616 below this metric, now at $92,800,"" Thielen said in a note to clients.  ""If the 2024 consolidation pattern repeats, bitcoin could decline to around $82,000 before stabilizing,"" Thielen added.  Some analysts are hopeful that regulatory clarity in the wake of Wednesday's Senate Committee hearing on ""Exploring a Bipartisan Legislative Framework for Digital Assets,"" could lift market valuations. ""A clear regulatory framework may be exactly what the market needs for institutions to confidently enter the space, unlocking the next wave of capital inflows.

""We're on the precipice of finally creating a bipartisan legislative framework for both stablecoins and market structure,"" Lummis said in her opening statement, referring to draft legislation she introduced with New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand as a natural counterpart to the House's Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. Stablecoins will be first on the committee's agenda though, she said,  echoing statements  made by White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks and South Carolina Republican Tim Scott, who chairs the overall Senate Banking Committee. Former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad, one of the hearing's four witnesses, told the lawmakers to focus on stablecoin legislation for the moment and defer any market structure efforts ""for several years."" ""For four years, the crypto industry has called on the SEC and CFTC to develop rules and guidance and to stop regulating by enforcement; that is now happening,"" he said. ""The SEC has dropped enforcement cases and launched a crypto task force to tackle these issues. We should let these regulatory issue initiatives make progress before rushing to rewrite the securities law."" Existing proposals to update market structure regulations to address crypto have the potential to ""create more confusion than clarity,"" he added, particularly around defining how a digital asset might be a security, commodity or something else. These proposals could potentially undermine existing securities laws, especially if they address decentralized finance. ""That term is used to describe a lot of things that aren't decentralized,"" Massad continued. ""There are almost always some vectors of control. And even if a process is decentralized or automated, that does not mean it should be exempt from regulation."" Virginia Democrat Mark Warner asked the panelists to discuss the possibility of stablecoin users conducting know-your-customer processes, noting that an issuer may conduct KYC but that a stablecoin may be transferred between wallets without those intermediate transfers going through a KYC process. ""I want to get to a regulatory framework that works, but I have seen — echoing what others have said from the classified side — oh my gosh, a whole bunch of bad stuff,"" Warner said. ""So help me figure out, and I recognize [for] some people, the anonymity and and the disintermediation role the blockchain plays, but how do we put some minimum protections from issuer all the way back to conversion to fiat?"" Lightspark co-founder and Chief Legal Officer Jai Massari noted that even though self-custodied wallets don't conduct KYC, ""there is an immutable on-chain record of those transactions that can be monitored, not only by the issuer, but [by] third parties, including law enforcement."" While mixers and other tools can obfuscate transactions, custodial wallets still conduct KYC at the end of a chain of transfers, she noted.

According to  a Wednesday X post  from Gemini co-founder and President Cameron Winklevoss, the SEC informed Gemini on Monday that it was closing its investigation into the New York-based crypto exchange and would not be filing enforcement charges against it. But the anti-climactic resolution to the long-running investigation was unsatisfying to Winklevoss, who said in his X post that the SEC’s retreat “does little to make up for the damage this agency has done to us, our industry, and America.” “The SEC cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal bills alone and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation,” Winklevoss wrote. “The SEC’s behavior in aggregate towards other crypto companies and projects cost orders of magnitude more and caused unquantifiable loss in economic growth for America.” Winklevoss said that, without consequences for both the SEC and the individual staff members involved in the investigations of Gemini and other crypto companies, other federal agencies could again, in the future, “bully, harass and attack a lawful industry and then decide one day to simply say we’re good and walk away.” In his post, Winklevoss suggested that any agency that “refuses to write rules before it opens an investigation or brings an enforcement action” should be required to reimburse defendants “for 3x [their] legal costs.” Winklevoss also called for all SEC staff members involved in the probe into Gemini to be publicly fired, and their “names, roles, and the actions they participated in should be posted on the SEC website.” “It should not be acceptable to bring the full might of the U.S. government to bear against fledgling companies in a nascent industry and then hide behind a faceless agency or say you were ‘just doing your job’ or ‘following orders.’ These individuals had a choice,” Winklevoss wrote. “They could have asked to be reassigned or resigned. Nobody was forcing them to work at the SEC. Nonetheless they chose to violate their oath and the agency’s mission to ‘make a positive impact on the U.S. economy, our capital markets, and people’s lives’ and instead aided and abetted an unlawful war against a lawful industry.” The SEC’s decision to drop its probe into Gemini comes shortly after it dropped similar investigations into Uniswap Labs, Robinhood Crypto and OpenSea.

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade Goes Live Avalanche Visa card launched Ethereum Foundation executive director leaving Hackers using GitHub to steal bitcoin Network News PECTRA GOES LIVE ON TESTNET : Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade went live on the Holesky testnet Feb. 24 but failed to finalize in the expected time. The Pectra hard fork combines together  11 major upgrades , or ""Ethereum improvement proposals"" (EIPs), into one package. At the heart of this is EIP-7702, which is supposed to improve the user-experience of crypto wallets. The proposal, which was scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in  just 22 minutes , will allow wallets to have some smart contract capabilities, as part of a broader strategy to bring  account abstraction to Ethereum — a concept that makes the usability of wallets a lot less clunky. Another key proposal, EIP-7251, will allow validators  to increase the maximum amount they can stake  from 32 to 2,048 ETH. The proposal is supposed to ease some of the technicalities that validators who  stake ETH  face today: Those that stake more than their 32 ETH have to spread that across multiple validators, making the process a bit of a nuisance. By lifting the maximum stake limit and combining those validators, it could speed up the process of setting up new nodes. Holesky is the first of two testnets to run through a simulation of Pectra. The next test is supposed to occur on the Sepolia testnet on Mar. 5. But  according to  Christine Kim, a Vice President of Research at Galaxy, developers could delay it depending on the scale of today's issue. After Pectra goes live on both testnets, developers will ink in a final date to activate the upgrade on mainnet.  — Margaux Nijkerk   Read more . MIYAGUCHI LEAVES ETHEREUM FOUNDATION ROLE : Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi is leaving her position to transition to a new role as president at the organization. The news comes as the nonprofit  goes through a leadership shake-up  and as Ethereum has become  less popular for new builders  in recent months, with  some even blaming  Miyaguchi’s leadership as for why the blockchain’s token price is lagging behind other cryptocurrencies. “This new opportunity will allow me to continue supporting EF’s institutional relationships, and to expand the reach of our vision and culture more broadly,” Miyaguchi  wrote in a blog post  published Feb. 25. The Ethereum Foundation is a nonprofit that supports the development of the Ethereum blockchain. Founded in 2014, Miyaguchi joined in 2018 and has been the executive director ever since. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote  in a post  on X that “every success of the EF - the steady execution of Ethereum hard forks, client interop workshops, Devcon, Ethereum's culture and steadfast commitment to its mission and values, and more - is in part a result of Aya's stewardship.”  — Margaux Nijkerk   Read more .  AVALANCHE VISA CARD LAUNCHES : The Avalanche Foundation, the non-profit that helps steward the development of the Avalanche blockchain, said its much-anticipated Avalanche Card, a Visa credit card that allows users to purchase items with their cryptocurrency, is live and ready to be used. The card was developed in collaboration with Rain, a blockchain-based card issuing platform. It enables users to spend their Avalanche tokens (AVAX), wrapped AVAX, and stablecoins USDT and USDC at any store that takes Visa, the foundation said in an email. While other teams  have also released credit cards  tied to a user's crypto holdings, the news signals the further integration between traditional financial technologies and cryptocurrency. The Avalanche Foundation  said in October  that it planned to introduce the card, focusing on signing up users from Latin America and the Caribbean. According  to the card’s website , the credit card will be linked to users' “new self-custody wallet and unique address per asset.” “In a move to double down on mainstream adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), Avalanche remains committed to powering accessible inroads to blockchain for every type of user,” the team said.  — Margaux Nijkerk  Read more . HACKERS USE GITHUB TO NAB BTC : The GitHub code you use to build a trendy application or patch existing bugs might just be used to steal your bitcoin (BTC) or other crypto holdings, according to a Kaspersky report. GitHub is a popular tool among developers of all types, but even more so among crypto-focused projects, where a simple application may generate millions of dollars in revenue. The report warned users of a “GitVenom” campaign that’s been active for at least two years but is steadily on the rise, involving planting malicious code in fake projects on the popular code repository platform. The attack starts with seemingly legitimate GitHub projects — like making Telegram bots for managing bitcoin wallets or tools for computer games. Each comes with a polished README file, often AI-generated, to build trust. But the code itself is a Trojan horse: For Python-based projects, attackers hide nefarious script after a bizarre string of 2,000 tabs, which decrypts and executes a malicious payload. For JavaScript, a rogue function is embedded in the main file, triggering the launch attack. Once activated, the malware pulls additional tools from a separate hacker-controlled GitHub repository. Once the system is infected, various other programs kick in to execute the exploit. How can users protect themselves? By scrutinizing any code before running it, verifying the project’s authenticity, and being suspicious of overly polished READMEs or inconsistent commit histories. Because researchers don’t expect these attacks to stop anytime soon: “We expect these attempts to continue in the future, possibly with small changes in the TTPs,” Kaspersky said.  — Shaurya Malwa  Read more .

A group of investors originally sued Uniswap Labs, the company behind the decentralized protocol of the same name, and some of its venture capital investors in 2022, alleging that the company was responsible for harming investors by allowing scam tokens to be issued on its protocol. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . District Court Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York (SDNY)  sided with Uniswap in 2023  and  scrapped the suit  before it went to trial, likening the plaintiffs’ arguments to “a suit attempting to hold an application like Venmo or Zelle liable for a drug deal that used the platform to facilitate a fund transfer.” Plaintiffs  appealed  Failla’s ruling in September 2023, but were largely shut down by the fresh decision from the Second Circuit on Wednesday. The Second Circuit judges affirmed Failla’s decision to throw out the plaintiffs' claims under both the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, writing: “In sum, we agree with the district court that it 'defies logic' that a drafter of a smart contract, a computer code, could be held liable under the Exchange Act for a third party user’s misuse of the platform,” the filing read. The only part of Failla’s ruling that was vacated and remanded back to a district court – meaning the lower court will hear this sliver of the the plaintiffs’ case again – were the state law claims, which essentially seek to try similar allegations under state, rather than federal law, in New York, North Carolina and Idaho. The ruling is a win for Uniswap, fresh off the heels of Tuesday's announcement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would drop its investigation into the decentralized exchange which, under former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, was being probed for allegedly operating as an unregistered securities broker and unregistered securities exchange, as well as issuing an unregistered security.

Moynihan said that he believes there will certainly be a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, arguing that given these digital assets function just like money market funds or bank accounts. This is dependent on Congress passing legislation; lawmakers and White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks have suggested legislation may move within President Donald Trump's first 100 days. “It’s pretty clear there’s going to be a stablecoin, which is going to be fully dollar-backed, [...] so you’ll have a Bank of America coin and a U.S. Dollar deposit and we’ll be able to move them back and forth because now it hasn’t been legal for us to do it but it’s just like another foreign currency,” he said. Compared to firms like J.P. Morgan and Citigroup, Bank of America has been cautious in its crypto involvement. But shifting regulations may force its hand.  The Trump Administration has made it clear that it will support any efforts in the crypto space in part by providing clearer regulatory guidelines, likely increasing competition among Wall Street banks in the sector. Charles Schwab, another bank that had previously held back, recently hired a head of digital assets as it explores opportunities in the space. The stablecoin economy has received support from both Democrats and Republicans, making the establishment of laws for these types of digital assets simpler than for other areas in crypto. To move things along, a group of lawmakers earlier this month promised that Congress would pass legislation on stablecoins within the first 100 days of Trump being in office. While Democrats have expressed concerns about the use of stablecoins for illicit activities, Republicans have full control of Congress, making it likely that it will pass a friendly approach to the digital asset, though any final bill will likely need some sort of bipartisan support.

But while the SEC and CFTC now have crypto-friendly chairmen, both state regulators and Attorneys General are poised to take their place as aggressive crypto enforcers. For years, the SEC’s aggressive “regulation by enforcement” approach stifled the growth of the crypto industry and caused many to call for a comprehensive regulatory framework that would put an end to the “war on crypto” once and for all. For this reason, many in the industry banded together to lend their support to pro-crypto candidates. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Node Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . That strategy bore fruit. Donald Trump was elected as the first president to tout his support for the crypto industry, despite his somewhat antagonistic stance towards crypto during his previous term. Since taking office, Trump appointed David Sacks as the nation’s first “Crypto Czar,” established a President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets and appointed interim SEC and CFTC Chairs that have already been expressing their support for the crypto industry. But those federal changes won’t end aggressive enforcement actions from state regulators who face public pressure to take action to reign in crypto. Many in the industry have already faced aggressive enforcement from regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which recently obtained a  $37 million settlement  from a crypto lending platform. Regulators like NYDFS were aggressive even when the SEC engaged in aggressive tactics against crypto, so when the SEC scales back its efforts, you can expect them to fill in the void. Other states are following New York’s lead. In late 2023, California enacted the Digital Financial Assets Law, which empowered its Department of Financial Protection and Innovation to license and regulate digital assets. And the Illinois legislature recently began to consider a new bill called the Digital Assets and Consumer Protection Act that would empower the state to regulate any company engaged in “digital asset business activity” with an Illinois resident. State Attorneys General It’s possible that new federal legislation could limit the ability of state regulators to bring their own enforcement matters. On Feb. 4, House and Senate Committee Chairs expressed confidence in the passage of comprehensive legislation that would create a regulatory framework for crypto within the next 100 days. Because federal law preempts state law, the new legislation could rein in some state regulatory activity. But even if state regulators are hemmed in by new legislation, that legislation would not limit the ability of state Attorneys General to file lawsuits alleging fraud by crypto-related businesses. State AGs previously brought those lawsuits when the SEC’s “regulation by enforcement” crusade was in full swing. In 2023, New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit alleging that a crypto trading platform falsely represented itself as an exchange. Later that year, the platform settled for $22 million and agreed not to do business with New Yorkers going forward. To be sure, a national regulatory framework and having pro-crypto regulators in Washington will provide more certainty and predictability for the crypto industry. But anyone who believes that “regulation by enforcement” is at an end is naïve. You can still expect aggressive lawsuits and regulator activity in the years to come. The venue may move from the SEC to the states, but the impact on crypto businesses and their customers will remain.",17:20,17:20,en,20250226,The U.S. War on Crypto Isn’t Over,17:20,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/02/26/the-u-s-war-on-crypto-isn-t-over,The U.S. War on Crypto Isn’t Over,CoinDesk,"sec-enforcement,donald-trump,nydfs",article_page,renato-mariotti,metered

Despite the decline in bitcoin, Strategy's BTC acquisition remains profitable. Since initiating purchases in August 2020, the company is up 32% on its holdings, with an average cost basis of $66,300 per BTC and an unrealized profit of $10.65 billion at bitcoin's current price of about $87,000.  The forced sales question A closer look at Strategy’s convertible debt highlights potential “liquidation prices” or forced bitcoin sales. Notably, all of the company's 499,096 BTC remain unencumbered, meaning Strategy has not pledged any bitcoin as collateral. An earlier convertible note using bitcoin as collateral with  Silvergate Bank  was fully repaid. According to  Bitcoin Overflow  on X, Strategy has $8.2 billion in total outstanding debt, backed by 499,096 BTC, currently valued at $43.4 billion. The short answer: As long as the value of Strategy's bitcoin exceeds its debt levels, the company would not need to sell any of its BTC holdings. In other words, bitcoin would have to decline all the way to approximately $16,500, or roughly another 80% from current levels. Taking a more detailed look, two of the six outstanding convertible bonds—the 2029 and 2030 issues—are below their offering price. They're large bonds, though, accounting for $5 billion out of the $8.2 billion total. Even then, the debt does not mature until 2029, allowing time for recovery.  And in theory, Strategy could roll over more paper, if that were to happen. If the value of the company's bitcoin were to drop below debt levels at the time the convertible bonds matured, and the MSTR stock price was below the conversion price (which would be very likely in that scenario), Strategy — in order to prevent massive dilution in its stock — would likely decide to sell bitcoin to repay the bonds in cash rather than converting them into equity.

20250226,coindesk-indices,The premium given to the company’s massive bitcoin holdings will exist as long as investors believe it will continue to increase the amount of its bitcoin held per share.,20:58,Opinion,20250226,f2ec388f-5935-4028-b5a9-48062d181374,20250226,"Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), the SaaS-based business intelligence company formerly known as MicroStrategy that pioneered a bitcoin treasury strategy, is currently trading at a $73 billion market cap, ~1.6x the value of its underlying bitcoin holdings. This so-called “MSTR premium” has caused much misunderstanding, healthy skepticism and even consternation, but with a decade of deep equities experience, we believe that there are three reasons why the MSTR premium is justified. These are particularly valid during periods of rising bitcoin price expectations, as we are in now.

CHART: MSTR’s premium to NAV Source: MSTR-Tracker.com, GSR First, Strategy takes on leverage by issuing equity and debt to invest the proceeds into bitcoin, earning the difference between the return on bitcoin and its cost of capital (ie. “carry”). Importantly, Strategy earns this carry not just this year, but also in future years as well, and investors simply present-value this expected future carry and include it in MSTR’s market cap. In fact, this is a major reason why MSTR’s premium will fluctuate with market expectations of future bitcoin returns. Nevertheless, the first reason MSTR trades at a premium to its BTC holdings is that investors pull future BTC carry to the present. Second, Strategy monetizes intelligent capital markets issuance for the benefit of shareholders. It accretes value via convertible debt issuance, where it not only gets paid to offer bitcoin-like returns to the bond market, but also for the volatility inherent in its stock as convertible bond arbitrageurs make more money with a more volatile underlying asset. In addition, MSTR issues equity, mostly through at-the-money equity issuance programs, at a premium to book value, which is by definition accretive to shareholders. In fact, issuing equity at twice book value is tantamount to selling $1 for $2, or conversely, buying BTC at 50% off. This is how Strategy was able to generate a 74% increase in the amount of its bitcoin held per share last year, equivalent to 140,630 BTC, or $14 billion of value for shareholders. Lastly, the entire construct takes advantage of bitcoin and crypto’s nascency, the fact that cryptocurrencies are in secular expansion and that bitcoin’s price has tended to rise over time. For those not yet convinced, we offer the following thought experiment: If I had a magic bank account with $100 USD in it that paid you a 69% interest rate, how much money would you pay me for that? While the answer may vary from person to person, it is likely much more than $100, meaning that the bank account would trade at a premium to its underlying USD (i.e. NAV). This is exactly what is happening with MSTR, as it has increased its BTC per share at a 69% annual rate since it began investing in bitcoin in August 2020. This increase in BTC per share (i.e. in-kind yield) is higher during bull markets and lower during bear markets, but it has generally risen over time. And while there is no guarantee that Strategy will continue to increase its BTC per share in the future, MSTR is guiding for a 15%+ increase this year and 6-10% in each of the following two years. Risks abound, of course — MSTR investors take on basis risk to the price of BTC and the stock tends to move more than bitcoin in both directions. Relatedly, the premium may move up or down in the future, and the stock will likely trade at a discount (i.e., below the value of its bitcoin holdings) during bear markets. But the premium exists because investors believe MSTR will continue to increase the amount of its bitcoin per share in the future, and they are willing to pay up for that now.

Most notably, institutional investors are moving on from testing the waters with bitcoin to seeking diversified exposure to the broad crypto market.

Historical performance is not an indication of future performance, and any investment may go down in value. In   2024, institutional investors started to recognize that the market-neutral position for multi-asset portfolios involves investing approximately 1.5% in cryptocurrencies, as determined by the market portfolio. They also realized that including cryptocurrencies in diversified multi-asset portfolios can also potentially improve their risk/return profiles. While allocating approximately 1.5% to cryptocurrencies became a reasonable strategy for investors without a specific investment thesis against the asset class, a question arose as to whether investors should allocate the entire 1.5% to bitcoin or diversify that allocation across multiple cryptocurrencies. Figure 2: Cryptocurrency market caps Source: Artemis Terminal, WisdomTree. As of 31 January 2025, using US Dollar market caps. You cannot invest directly in an index.  Historical performance is not an indication of future performance and any investment may go down in value. For background, bitcoin dominates the cryptocurrency market, accounting for 55% of the total market capitalization. The next 19 largest cryptocurrencies collectively make up around 33%, while the remaining 12% is distributed among all other cryptocurrencies. This distribution has sparked a debate among institutional investors about the optimal approach to crypto investing. Advocates of a focused strategy often champion the idea of investing exclusively in bitcoin. This preference is largely driven by bitcoin's established track record and its perception as a digital store of value akin to gold. Bitcoin’s resilience and historical performance have rendered it an attractive option for those seeking a relatively safer entry into the world of cryptocurrencies. However, there are also strong proponents of diversification. These investors argue that spreading investments across a basket of cryptocurrencies can harness the growth potential of emerging digital assets, while simultaneously mitigating the risks associated with the volatility of any single cryptocurrency. By diversifying, investors can potentially benefit from the rise of new innovative projects and technologies within the space, aligning their portfolios with the broader developments in the digital economy. Ultimately, the decision to focus solely on bitcoin or to adopt a diversified investment strategy depends on individual investor preferences, risk tolerance and market outlook. Investors without a strong opinion on the long-term crypto market winners seeking a long-term investment may find a market cap-weighted approach to diversification advantageous. As the space matures, investors will likely seek allocations that evolve over time in tandem with the broader cryptocurrency market.

",,Opinion,20250226,811caace-a610-441a-aaa5-51882d21a712,,"Having served as the first chief of the SEC’s crypto unit from 2017 to 2019, I’m often asked what kind of crypto enforcement we should expect to see from the new administration. My first answer is that I do not know. My second answer is that I believe it will be different, but it will not disappear. To anticipate the future of crypto enforcement, we should begin by reviewing the past. Story continues Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Node Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . The beginning The SEC’s crypto enforcement unit was formed in 2017 during the first Trump Administration. The early focus was on one, fraud, and two, core capital raising events. Regulation of capital raising is the principal purpose of the Securities Act of 1933. When an investor gives money to an entrepreneur who will use it in a business to generate profit, the investor is entitled to certain information about the business. Early crypto investigations were focused on this fundraising activity, which was usually in the form of an unregistered initial coin offering (“ICO”). The idea was that many ICOs at that time were not so different in substance than equity or debt offerings, and should be regulated similarly. The industry responded responsibly and now, crypto entrepreneurs often raise money in compliance with the federal securities laws. In one of several options, some offerings are exempt from SEC registration because they are limited to accredited investors. The entrepreneurs then use the capital to build a blockchain protocol or other crypto product. Once built, sales of tokens probably are not securities offerings because people are not buying tokens as an investment in someone’s business. Even if there is hope for profit, that profit would come from the activities of the buyers and other participants, not the efforts of a central business manager. The last four years During the last four years, the SEC has focused more of its enforcement activity on secondary markets such as centralized trading platforms and decentralized protocols. It is less clear how the federal securities laws apply to these markets. These transactions generally do not involve a central entrepreneur collecting money from investors and using it in a business. Instead, there are thousands or even millions of crypto participants interacting with each other, sometimes anonymously via autonomous software. Token buyers might not know who sold them tokens and there may be no central actor that’s key to future success. Federal district courts have reached different conclusions and there are reports that the SEC might drop one of these key cases. More broadly, enforcement became the dominant focus of SEC regulation. The SEC doubled the size of the crypto unit, creating new supervisory and trial attorney positions. It spent years and a tremendous amount of resources litigating several non-fraud cases. Many additional non-unit lawyers worked on crypto investigations, and crypto appeared to be the main focus of SEC enforcement. This approach did not generate useful guidance to the industry. Many SEC rules have technical aspects that are incompatible with the anonymous decentralized ledger that is blockchain technology. Under the enforcement approach of recent years, the very premise of the technology was treated not as a feature, but as a bug. The result was existential enforcement risk to a burgeoning industry and economic activity being pushed offshore. The future I do not believe the crypto industry wants a Wild West of no regulation. They want a sensible rulebook that makes compliance feasible, and they also want regulators to crack down on fraud. No legitimate actor benefits from fraud in the industry. What does this mean for the next four years of enforcement? First, enforcement is just one component of regulation. We likely will see increased resources dedicated to the other parts of effective regulation — new guidance and rules that offer an achievable regulatory framework. Acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda recently announced a  new crypto task force  for developing a “sensible regulatory path,” and Commissioner Hester Peirce, who will lead the task force,  included in her objectives  “preserv[ing] industry’s ability to offer products and services.” The dedicated crypto unit also has been reduced in size and repurposed to cyber and emerging technologies, with many staff returning to general enforcement duties. Second, we could see a renewed focus on fighting fraud. The Commission did not stop bringing crypto fraud cases during the last four years, but many headline cases were non-fraud regulatory disputes. That might change; as Commissioner Peirce said in her objectives speech, “We do not tolerate liars, cheaters, and scammers.” Third, once there is a new rulebook, we can expect the SEC to enforce those rules. That will take time. We might see a transition period, with some non-fraud cases but more focus on writing the new rulebook. Once adopted, enforcement of that rulebook could come after a fair notice period for the industry to adapt to it. Conclusion I expect SEC crypto enforcement to continue, but with different priorities. Investor protection will be balanced with the SEC’s co-equal mandates of facilitating capital formation and maintaining orderly markets. The crypto industry is filled with good actors who want to be compliant; they just need a rulebook that makes compliance achievable. A renewed approach will allow the industry to grow without abandoning investor protection. The SEC has been the most assertive crypto regulator so far, but it is not alone. Other federal agencies may emerge as co-equal regulatory leaders, either through legislation or otherwise, especially if the SEC no longer takes the position that every cryptocurrency (except Bitcoin) is a security. Some state authorities have been active in crypto, and that likely will continue or even increase. A client recently reminded me that there will be another election in four years. The new regulatory approach, and the industry’s business and product decisions, must be durable. If they are not, the renewed approach to crypto over the next four years could be undone as easily as that of the last four years.",15:53,15:53,en,20250226,The Future of Crypto Enforcement in the U.S.,15:53,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/02/26/the-future-of-crypto-enforcement-in-the-u-s,The Future of Crypto Enforcement in the U.S.,CoinDesk,"opinion,sec,sec-enforcement",article_page,robert-cohen,metered

XRP prices are up 2.2% in the past 24 hours, outperforming a 1.1% decline in bitcoin following Tuesday’s market carnage. Ripple  said in a Tuesday update  the XRP Ledger network will build out more compliance functions and expanded lending, among other features, to let institutions meet regulatory requirements and offer new lending options. These include flexible tokens, a lending system, an EVM sidechain, and permissioned settings that take place directly on the decentralized network (without any intermediaries). The updates are in addition to features already live on the network, including clawback — a feature allowing the issuer to reclaim tokens tied to illicit activity — to decentralized identity applications. Flexible tokens are digital items representing anything — like bonds or collectibles — and come with extra details to make them more useful. A new lending tool will let companies borrow and lend directly on the XRP Ledger without needing banks or extra steps. It’s designed to be safe and follow the rules. Permission settings can let companies set rules about who can use certain features, keeping things private and secure — helping meet legal standards and protect sensitive financial activities. Furthermore, the release of an XRPL EVM sidechain, which is slated for a mainnet launch in the second quarter of 2025, is expected to attract more developers to the network. This development aims to integrate developers from the EVM ecosystem into the XRPL framework by enabling support for protocols that are not feasible on the existing XRPL infrastructure.

""But until they start making their presence felt, the loss of energy will create a drag on the market,"" Hougan  said on X . On the macroeconomic front, the optimism seen after the Nov. 4 election is being replaced by caution, as evidenced by  Tuesday's release  of the U.S. consumer confidence. The gauge dropped to an eight-month low, and the one-year inflation expectations were highest for 1.5 years, with President Donald Trump's tariffs singled out as the primary concern in almost every household and business survey. The dour sentiment and a strengthening yen might keep the upside in risk assets restricted for some time.

In January he issued an  executive order  laying out specific actions, including one being for the nation to move forward with a more crypto-friendly regulatory framework. In February, Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty introduced a stablecoin oversight bill that would establish a regulatory regime for  U.S. dollar-backed  coins. “Whether you’re an offshore company or based in Hong Kong, if you want to offer your dollar stablecoin in the U.S., you should need to register in the U.S. just like we have to go register everywhere else,” Allaire said.

The recent price drop below $90,000 has left a majority of options out-of-the-money (OTM) and traders facing significant unrealized losses. An option allows the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific price within a certain time period. According to Deribit data , out of the $5 billion of notional value that is due to expire, $3.9 billion (78%) of it is due to expire out-the-money (OTM), meaning these contracts will expire worthless.  Almost 100% of calls are OTM, which are bullish bets, as the bitcoin price dropped significantly over the past few days, leaving investors with a significant amount of unrealized losses.  While, the remaining $1.1 billion (22%), was in-the-money (ITM) with it being dominated with puts. ITM puts are investors having their strike prices above the spot price, meaning they hold value.  However, max pain is at $98,000, that is, $10,000 higher than the current spot price. Max pain is the price at which option sellers, typically institutions, achieve maximum profit, while buyers experience the greatest amount of losses.  As the max pain price is so much higher than the spot price, this could incentivize options sellers to push bitcoin price higher closer to the pain level, according to  PowerTrade .  ""With the end of the month approaching, bitcoin options traders should take note. Max Pain for Feb. 28 sits at $98,000, with a massive $5 billion notional value.

GDA's new deployment includes two 20 MW buildings at the Pyote site, bringing it to 195 MW, and a 10 MW container setup at the Vernon site, bringing it to 70 MW. The Pyote site can be expanded up to 370 MW, according to GDA’s website.  The bitcoin mining firm will be taking advantage of Texas’ demand-response program, meaning that the mining operation will turn off its rigs during peaks in electricity demand, and be compensated for it. GDA operates 20 data centers across multiple jurisdictions, including Texas, South Carolina, Sweden and Argentina. A number of these centers  rely  on green energy, including wind, hydro, nuclear and flared gas. “Bitcoin mining is GDA’s core business.

While the sell-off has been steep, it corresponds to only a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the rally that started at Nov. 4's low of 49.5 cents through the Jan. 16 high of $3.40. A retracement is a drop from the principal trend. That's positive news for XRP bulls, as that level, along with the 50% and 61.8% ratios, indicates potential areas for the price to resume its previous trend, according to the  CME's explainer . Trends often pull back to these levels before initiating larger rallies. That means XRP bulls have reason to be optimistic about potential gains ahead. Moreover, there has been some positive news flow regarding XRP recently. On Monday,  ETF.com said  Brazil's securities regulator had registered the first spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) as the Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Fund entered a so-called pre-operational phase with Brazil's Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM). U.S. regulators are also reviewing applications for XRP ETFs. A potential approval could accelerate institutional demand for XRP if the uptake of bitcoin ( BTC ) and ether ( ETH ) ETFs is any guide. XRP's daily chart with Fibonacci retracements. (CoinDesk/TradingView)   The Fibonacci series comprises adding the two preceding numbers to find the next number. The sequence, which has been of interest to mathematicians and scientists for centuries, occurs in the following manner: 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and so on. The ratio of any number to the next higher number is close to 0.618 and if you divide any number in the sequence by the one two spaces to the right, you get 38.2. Traders use these ratios and the 50% level to predict how far an asset might retrace the primary trend, in XRP's case, the bull run. It's a different story for dogecoin because a primary trend is considered to have ended when a retracement exceeds the 61.8% level. The world's largest meme cryptocurrency by market value has dropped below 21 cents, retracing more than 70% of the rally marked by October lows near 10 cents and a high of 48.4 cents in December.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Protocol Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . The report warned users of a “GitVenom” campaign that’s been active for at least two years but is steadily on the rise, involving planting malicious code in fake projects on the popular code repository platform. The attack starts with seemingly legitimate GitHub projects — like making Telegram bots for managing bitcoin wallets or tools for computer games. Each comes with a polished README file, often AI-generated, to build trust. But the code itself is a Trojan horse: For Python-based projects, attackers hide nefarious script after a bizarre string of 2,000 tabs, which decrypts and executes a malicious payload. For JavaScript, a rogue function is embedded in the main file, triggering the launch attack. Once activated, the malware pulls additional tools from a separate hacker-controlled GitHub repository. (A tab organizes code, making it readable by aligning lines. The payload is the core part of a program that does the actual work — or harm, in malware’s case.) Once the system is infected, various other programs kick in to execute the exploit. A Node.js stealer harvests passwords, crypto wallet details, and browsing history, then bundles and sends them via Telegram. Remote access trojans like AsyncRAT and Quasar take over the victim’s device, logging keystrokes and capturing screenshots. A “clipper” also swaps copied wallet addresses with the hackers’ own, redirecting funds. One such wallet netted 5 BTC — worth $485,000 at the time — in November alone. Active for at least two years, GitVenom has hit users hardest in Russia, Brazil, and Turkey, though its reach is global, per Kaspersky. The attackers keep it stealthy by mimicking active development and varying their coding tactics to evade antivirus software. How can users protect themselves? By scrutinizing any code before running it, verifying the project’s authenticity, and being suspicious of overly polished READMEs or inconsistent commit histories. Because researchers don’t expect these attacks to stop anytime soon: “We expect these attempts to continue in the future, possibly with small changes in the TTPs,” Kaspersky concluded in its post.",6:29,6:29,en,20250226,Bitcoin News: Hackers Are Stealing BTC from Malicious GitHub Code Bases,6:29,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/02/26/hackers-are-using-fake-github-code-to-steal-your-bitcoin-kaspersky,Bitcoin News: Hackers Are Stealing BTC from Malicious GitHub Code Bases,CoinDesk,"github,hack",article_page,shaurya-malwa,metered

More importantly, investors withdrew funds from U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) at an unprecedented rate.

Fidelity's FBTC saw the most outflow, totaling $344.65 million, followed by $164.37 million in redemptions from BlackRock's IBIT. The remaining funds registered outflows of less than $100 million each. The weakening appetite for these ETFs could be attributed to the decline in the premium in the CME-listed bitcoin futures, which has dented the appeal of the cash and carry arbitrage. Moreover, these BTC and ETH carry trades now offer barely more than the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, which offered a yield of 4.32% at press time.  The strategy, heavily favored by institutions since early last year, involves buying the spot ETF and simultaneously selling the CME futures to pocket the premium while bypassing the price direction risks. According to Velo Data, the annualized one-month basis (premium) in the CME bitcoin futures dropped to 4% Tuesday, the lowest in nearly two years, and down significantly from almost 15% in December.

Gold fell 1.3% on Tuesday after a profit-taking bout following a record rally where it touched a new high Monday, but rose higher in Asian morning hours Wednesday. Macro Outlook Reasons for Tuesday’s panic ranged from money flowing out of bitcoin ETFs, with over $1 billion pulled out in the last two weeks, to a stronger yen, a perceived safe-haven currency whose growth tends to pull down riskier bets. Expectations for easier U.S. Federal Monetary policy  have surged , however, with prediction markets putting chances of a May rate cut to 30% over the past week, and the chances of two rate cuts by June have more than tripled to 15%. These hopes come after a gauge of U.S. consumer confidence marked its deepest fall since August 2021, decreasing 7 points in February to 98.3 in its third straight decline. U.S economic data and policies tend to impact prices of risk assets such as bitcoin, as crypto traders bet on expectations of retail participation as idle cash frees up. Traders Remain Cautious Hopes of an altcoin rally remain muted among traders, with fresh dollar inflows expected to flow exclusively to BTC. BTC finally broke out of its range, dipping below 90k for the first time in a month and now hovering just below that level, triggering over USD 200mm in liquidations over the past few hours. Market sentiment remains under pressure following Trump’s decision to implement tariffs on Canada and Mexico and curb Chinese investment. Front-end gamma was covering as BTC broke lower, with 1M implied volatility now back around 50v, while skews interestingly remain largely unchanged. “Zooming out, equities, fixed income, and gold have largely shrugged off the data points previously blamed for broader market weakness, with BTC remaining flat,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a broadcast message late Tuesday. “Rising BTC dominance and sliding altcoin prices suggest that alt bulls may already be fully long, with any new dollar inflows going exclusively into BTC.” “We remain cautious. Recent BTC demand has been driven primarily by institutions like MicroStrategy financed through equity-linked note issuances. With crypto-related issuance accounting for roughly 19% of total issuance over the last 14 months, the market for such financing may be nearing saturation — potentially dampening institutional demand if spot continues to stay muted,” it added. Players like Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) have been the main drivers of BTC demand in the  past weeks and months , funding their purchases by raising their stock.

This happened on Monday when OKX announced  a $500 million-plus settlement  with the U.S. Department of Justice after failing to secure a money transmitter license and allegedly facilitating  $5 billion  in ""suspicious transactions and criminal proceeds."" STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . OKX’s meticulous planning makes for some fascinating reading. The secret crisis management document seen by CoinDesk refers to a messaging “SWAT Team” that can be mobilized to implement various ways the firm’s top executives can communicate a settlement via social media and when speaking to reporters. Well in advance of Monday’s large fine and forfeiture, OKX had produced specific guidance with regards to settling with the DOJ, as well as the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC, or sanctions watchdog), for example. A favored approach is to point out that the entire crypto industry has been broadly under intense scrutiny and that OKX is cooperating fully with regulators, the document said. This was echoed in Monday’s press release which said OKX “appreciates” the DOJ’s “collaboration.” Since the administration of President Donald Trump took over last month, the main focus for regulatory agencies in the crypto arena has been to reverse their previously aggressive enforcement stance, with the SEC  dropping ongoing litigation  and  closing   investigations . But not so in the case of OKX, which, like Kucoin with its recent  $300 million penalty  and  Binance  back in 2023, has been forced into costly settlements. The guidance refers to what is expected from OKX founder Star Xu, President Hong Fang and other executives when it comes to “their social media actions in two scenarios: 1) Leak before OFAC settlement, 2) upon OFAC settlement.” Also, on the issue of OFAC, if executives are asked if OKX has served sanctioned markets, one suggestion is to say: “Customers from sanctioned markets slipped through when we had immature compliance controls and systems [...] It is a very small and insignificant part of the Okcoin or OKX customer base.” Indeed, Monday's press release from OKX acknowledged that U.S. customers were able to trade on the global exchange. ""The total number of U.S. customers involved – which are no longer on the platform – amounted to a small percentage of the Company’s worldwide customer population,"" the release said. Brand awareness Another priority for OKX is how the firm choreographs its big-ticket sponsorship arrangements with the likes of Manchester City football club, F1 team McLaren and the Tribeca Film Festival.  The firm estimates that around $100 million per annum  has been spent on these partnerships over the past three years. The action plan for brand partners involves the OKX marketing chief giving each partner a phone call “at the last hour before the news breaks.” The recommended strategy here is to say OKX has prepared for a regulatory review, given the heightened scrutiny on crypto firms. If asked why the exchange did not share information about this before, the document states that these are pending inquiries and non-public matters. There is also a bullet point suggesting the CMO and OKX’s head of legal “review clauses in our brand partner contracts again.” Don’t mention OKB Another detail that gets attention in the OKX planning document is the exchange’s native cryptocurrency, OKB. An obvious concern in the aftermath of FTX is any suggestion that OKB has been used as collateral or to finance any operations of OKX,  as was the case with FTX’s FTT token . Of course, the OKB exchange token hasn't been subject to anything like the iniquities of FTX’s exchange token. However, it was involved in  a sudden flash crash  in January 2024, after which OKX quickly offered to compensate users who had lost out. The token, which has a relatively thin trading volume and liquidity, saw 10 dormant wallets become active and begin trading just before the crash, according to Marina Khaustova, COO Crystal Intelligence, a blockchain analytics firm. Not long after the OKB crash, OKX executives Tim Byun, the former CEO of OKcoin and head of global government relations, and Head of Product Wei Lan  were let go by OKX . A source familiar with the situation said Byun was ""sacrificed"" following the OKB crash. Unsurprisingly, the OKX comms protocol emphasizes that execs should “refrain from mentioning OKB and reference this only if asked.” Media management Another part of the puzzle is how the exchange should deal with media inquiries. Should OKX receive emails or a phone call from a journalist looking for comment about ongoing investigations, the SWAT Team and PR team should go into action to “buy time by offering up leadership schedules” Meanwhile, the plan is “to contact key friendly publications for a parallel story to seed in a complimentary narrative to the originating story,” the document states. “1. Push for delay 2. Confirm friendly publications 3. Asynchronously queue up internal / external comms, so we hit send as the story comes out,” it said. OKX did not provide a comment by press time",21:40,21:40,en,20250225,How to Prepare for a Major Compliance Failure Settlement: The OKX Approach,21:40,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/02/25/how-to-prepare-for-a-major-compliance-failure-settlement-the-okx-approach,How to Prepare for a Major Compliance Failure Settlement: The OKX Approach,CoinDesk,"exclusive,okx,exchange",article_page,ian-allison,metered

The conclusion of our investigation is not only welcome — and just — relief for Uniswap Labs, but also for the broader DeFi community of builders, users, and developers working toward a better financial system for all of us,” the company said in a Tuesday blog post. Amanda Tuminelli, chief legal officer at the DeFi Education Fund, said in a statement to CoinDesk that the SEC’s decision to drop the investigation into Uniswap Labs “gives DeFi companies additional comfort to pivot from defending to embracing our right to build decentralized tech.” The SEC’s decision to close its investigation into Uniswap Labs is the latest in a wave of similarly-dropped investigations into crypto companies, including Robinhood Crypto and non-fungible token marketplace OpenSea. The SEC has also agreed to drop its case against Coinbase, pending approval from the agency’s commissioners, according to the crypto exchange.

According to the letter, Strive's clients hold shares of GameStop through the asset management's exchange-traded funds (ETFs), giving the firm ""a fiduciary responsibility and vested interest"" in GameStop's success. Cole said his firm holds GME stock in three different ETFs without disclosing the amount. A screenshot of Strive's report to GameStop (Strive/CoinDesk)   The letter comes after  reports surfaced  earlier this month about GameStop considering investing in alternative investments, including bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.  In the last two years, GameStop has reduced its operating losses and managed to offset these deficits through interest income from cash holdings generated from equity offerings, the letter said. These initiatives have stabilized GME's balance sheet and positioned the company for ""dynamic strategic moves,"" the letter adds.  Cole argues that bitcoin will be the new ""hurdle rate"" for capital deployment. The letter also argues that cash is a negative real return; bitcoin is deemed an inflation hedge in terms of outpacing monetary debasement. Strive's CEO suggests GameStop should focus on bitcoin and avoid other cryptocurrencies while leveraging capital markets to issue at-the-market (ATM) offerings and convertible debt securities.  The letter's suggestion mirrors what several other companies, including MicroStrategy, Semler Scientific and MARA Holdings, are already deploying. Most of the larger-cap stocks that have bought bitcoin in the open market have seen not only their stock price rally but also opened up new avenues for capital raises.

This past January, StarkWare’s SN Stack  went live . Despite various layer-2 stacks already live and  layer-3 games existing on those chains , the team behind Nums claim that their decision to build with Starknet’s technology is because it allows for more “computationally complex and more ambitious” applications, said Tarrence van As, the CEO of Cartridge, the main developer firm behind Nums, in an interview with CoinDesk. Starknet, which uses Cairo as its programming language, is “much easier to express these types of applications,” van As added.

Bitcoin touched that record a day ahead of the presidential inauguration amid a speculative frenzy in memecoins that hit its dénouement as the Trump team thought it a good idea to launch tokens associated with the incoming president and first lady. The tokens initially rocketed higher before quickly crashing and leaving just about everyone except insiders with massive losses. SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain on which much of the memecoins were created, is down more than 50% since then, leading the plunge in the major cryptos since that January weekend. Bitcoin bulls were promised a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and instead got TRUMP and MELANIA. Bybit hack delivers blow Even with the evisceration in memecoins and associated carnage in the broader crypto market over the past weeks, bitcoin managed to mostly stay in a tight range not that far below its record. As recently as 96 hours ago, the world's largest crypto was on the rise and seemed set to retake the $100,000 level. Then the Bybit hack hit. While bitcoiners were quick to point out the exploit had noting to do with Bitcoin and instead once again demonstrated the inherent weaknesses in Ethereum's technology, the plunge in ETH (down 15% and counting since) and the rest of crypto spread to BTC.

20250225,opinion,"As the transformative technology evolves, the opportunity for Web3 to play a significant role is growing rapidly. ",,Opinion,20250225,9db23648-01a1-4990-891e-0de189af2192,,"""Build for where the industry is going, not for where it is."" This mantra has fueled disruptive innovations for decades — Microsoft capitalized on microprocessors, Salesforce leveraged the cloud and Uber thrived in the mobile revolution. The same principle applies to AI — Generative AI is evolving so rapidly that building for today’s capabilities risks obsolescence. Historically, Web3 has played little role in this AI evolution. But can it adapt to the latest trends reshaping the industry? STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Node Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . 2024 was a pivotal year for generative AI, with groundbreaking research and engineering advancements. It was also the year that the Web3-AI narrative transitioned from speculative hype to glimpses of real utility. While the first wave of AI revolved around mega-models, long training cycles, vast compute clusters and deep enterprise pockets — making them largely inaccessible to Web3 — newer trends in 2024 are opening doors for meaningful Web3 integration. On the Web3-AI front, 2024 was dominated by speculative projects such as meme-driven agentic platforms that reflected bullish market sentiment but offered little real-world utility. As that hype fades, a window of opportunity is emerging to refocus on tangible use cases. The generative AI landscape of 2025 will be vastly different, with transformative shifts in research and technology. Many of these changes could catalyze Web3 adoption, but only if the industry builds for the future. Let’s examine five key trends shaping AI and the potential they present for Web3. 1. The reasoning race Reasoning has become the next frontier for large language models (LLMs). Recent models like GPT-01, DeepSeek R1, and Gemini Flash place reasoning capabilities at the core of their advancements. Functionally, reasoning allows AI to break down complex inference tasks into structured, multi-step processes, often leveraging Chain of Thought (CoT) techniques. Just as instruction-following became a standard for LLMs, reasoning will soon be a baseline capability for all major models. The Web3-AI opportunity Reasoning involves intricate workflows that require traceability and transparency — an area where Web3 shines. Imagine an AI-generated article where every reasoning step is verifiable on-chain, providing an immutable record of its logical sequence. In a world where AI-generated content dominates digital interactions, this level of provenance could become a fundamental need. Web3 can provide a decentralized, trustless layer to verify AI reasoning pathways, bridging a critical gap in today’s AI ecosystem. 2. Synthetic data training scales up A key enabler of advanced reasoning is synthetic data. Models like DeepSeek R1 use intermediate systems (such as R1-Zero) to generate high-quality reasoning datasets, which are then used for fine-tuning. This approach reduces dependence on real-world datasets, accelerating model development and improving robustness. The Web3-AI opportunity Synthetic data generation is a highly parallelizable task, ideal for decentralized networks. A Web3 framework could incentivize nodes to contribute compute power toward synthetic data generation, earning rewards based on dataset usage. This could foster a decentralized AI data economy in whichsynthetic datasets power open-source and proprietary AI models alike. 3. The shift to post-training workflows Early AI models relied on massive pretraining workloads requiring thousands of GPUs. However, models like GPT-01 have shifted focus to mid-training and post-training, enabling more specialized capabilities such as advanced reasoning. This shift dramatically alters compute requirements, reducing dependence on centralized clusters. The Web3-AI opportunity While pretraining demands centralized GPU farms, post-training can be distributed across decentralized networks. Web3 could facilitate decentralized AI model refinement, allowing contributors to stake compute resources in return for governance or financial incentives. This shift democratizes AI development, making decentralized training infrastructures more viable. 4. The rise of distilled small models Distillation, a process in which large models are used to train smaller, specialized versions, has seen a surge in adoption. Leading AI families such as Llama, Gemini, Gemma and DeepSeek now include distilled variants optimized for efficiency, enabling them to run on commodity hardware. The Web3-AI opportunity Distilled models are compact enough to run on consumer-grade GPUs or even CPUs, making them a perfect fit for decentralized inference networks. Web3-based AI inference marketplaces could emerge, in which nodes provide compute power to execute lightweight, distilled models. This would decentralize AI inference, reducing reliance on cloud providers and unlocking new tokenized incentive structures for participants. 5. The demand for transparent AI evaluations One of the biggest challenges in generative AI is evaluation. Many top-tier models have effectively memorized existing industry benchmarks, rendering them unreliable for assessing real-world performance. When you see a model scoring extremely high on a given benchmark, it's often because that benchmark has been included in the training corpus of the model. Today, no robust mechanisms exist for verifying model evaluation results, leading companies to rely on self-reported numbers in technical papers. The Web3-AI Opportunity Blockchain-based cryptographic proofs could introduce radical transparency into AI evaluations. Decentralized networks could verify model performance across standardized benchmarks, reducing reliance on unverifiable corporate claims. Additionally, Web3 incentives could encourage the development of new, community-driven evaluation standards, pushing AI accountability to new heights. Can Web3 adapt to the next wave of AI? Generative AI is undergoing a paradigm shift. The path to artificial general intelligence (AGI) is no longer dominated solely by monolithic models with lengthy training cycles. New breakthroughs — such as reasoning-driven architectures, synthetic dataset innovations, post-training optimizations and model distillation — are decentralizing AI workflows. Web3 was largely absent from the first wave of generative AI, but these emerging trends introduce fresh opportunities where decentralized architectures can provide real utility. The crucial question now is: can Web3 move fast enough to seize this moment and become a relevant force in the AI revolution?",15:21,15:21,en,20250225,5 New Trends in Generative AI That Web3 Needs to Be Ready For,15:21,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/02/25/5-new-trends-in-generative-ai-that-web3-needs-to-be-ready-for,5 New Trends in Generative AI That Web3 Needs to Be Ready For,CoinDesk,"ai,web3",article_page,jesus-rodriguez,metered

The project's token (its incentive mechanism) has more than doubled in the past 12 months amid torrid demand for Geodnet's services. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.

GPS satellites that tell your phone about how far you are from the next intersection are plenty good for a drive around town. Not so for Geodnet's user base of farming drones and industrial robots, said project lead Mike Horton. They need location data down ""to the size of a golf ball."" Nearly 14,000 base stations provide centimeter-level location data to Geodnet' clients, many of whom are oblivious to its crypto incentives: Anyone running a $700 base station earns new GEOD tokens, a model that shifts the normally astronomical cost of deploying equipment away from the company. ""Because of DePIN, we've been able to scale this thing crazy fast,"" said Horton. ""We built in two years what the industry has been working on for 20 years, and we now have twice as many stations as anyone else."" Multicoin's betting Geodnet's cheap, all-encompassing geospatial network will help facilitate the explosive growth of technologies that need accurate location data, particularly robots: self-driving vehicles, delivery drones, autonomous farming equipment. ""For these robots to function, they need to answer a fundamental question:  Where am I ?, wrote Multicoin Investment Partner Shayon Sengupta in a position paper. Geodnet's existing customers are powering over $3 million in annual recurring revenue, said Horton. He's targeting 2025 growth in India and South America, particularly in the farming sector. The investors are calling the fundraise a ""strategic"" investment in which they bought GEOD tokens directly from Geodnet Foundation, the entity behind the network. Geodnet last raised capital in  April 2024  from Coinfund, Pantera and VanEck.

20250225,tech,"Public bitcoin miners are rushing to build AI business lines, but there’s still room for their original mandate, says this investment bank analyst. ",15:27,Feature,20250225,Y6cImBLC4s530AxlF1cK9s,20250226,"Anyone paying attention to public bitcoin miner markets will know that artificial intelligence (AI) and business pivots to high performance compute (HPC) are all the rage among bitcoin miners. What started as a gradual trend last year has suddenly become a business strategy that many leading public bitcoin miners are exploring. This article first appeared on  Blockspace Media , the leading Bitcoin industry publication dedicated to covering Bitcoin tech, markets, mining, and ordinals.

See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . Core Scientific, Bit Digital, Hut 8, Hive and IREN currently have revenue-generating AI/HPC business lines, while  Crusoe Energy and Lancium ,  Cipher ,  Terawulf ,  Riot  and  Bitfarms  are in the development or exploratory phase. With SoftBank, OpenAI and others collectively pledging up to $500 billion to accelerate AI developments in the United States through  the Stargate Project , which was announced in January, where does the digital oil rush leave pure-play bitcoin miners? Kevin Dede, a managing director of equity research at investment bank H.C. Wainwright, thinks that there is plenty of room for both.  In a recent episode  of the Mining Pod’s Bitcoin Stock Show, Dede expressed that while he wouldn’t bet against miners who are serious about AI/HPC, he wouldn’t underestimate the prospects for pure-play bitcoin miners, either. Does the launch of Project Stargate change the conversation on AI pivots for bitcoin miners? I think the conversation changed when Core Scientific announced the  CoreWeave deal  six to eight months ago. That really shifted the dynamic. Another thing people might not consider is that bitcoin miners can compete at different scales. Project Stargate is about hyperscale facilities, but there are opportunities for smaller-scale implementations. Bit Digital and Applied Digital have shown that you don’t need hyperscale to succeed. There are many customers who want access to compute, and not all of them are hyperscalers. Riot recently decided to pause its 600-megawatt Corsicana Phase 2 to evaluate it for AI/HPC. Why do you think they did that? Riot has had activist investors buying stock, which is great for the stock price. The company has always been adamant about sticking to bitcoin mining. At their analyst meeting last June, CEO   Jason Les said they wouldn’t do HPC. Riot’s Corsicana facility is amazing. The question is: is 600MW of HPC worth more than 600MW of bitcoin mining? I think the answer is yes.The demand for HPC is growing, and the applications are evolving; we’re just scratching the surface. The real market is the enterprise market, where companies use AI to optimize production. Looking at Bit Digital and Core Scientific, which company’s strategy do you think has the most upside? Let’s start with Bit Digital. They bought GPUs and rented space in northern Iceland to address the needs of one customer, who I believe is based somewhere in Europe, to run models. Now, Iceland and Europe aren’t as close as you might think, which is important if they are running inference compute since mainland Europe would be the primary customer for that. The Enovum deal  came through and they secured their first site, which is about four megawatts. They’ve also just opened another site that they hope to have energized by this summer, aiming for five megawatts initially with plans to scale up to 35 megawatts in HPC capacity this year. Sam Tabar, their CEO, often points out that this acquisition opened the door to a potential 288 megawatts of HPC capacity. When it comes to assessing the risk, it really comes down to a number of factors. Bit Digital acquired a company with a proven track record of building and operating these sites. But, of course, that adds another layer of risk beyond the baseline execution risk. You’re layering on the risk that they might stumble during the construction and operation of their next set of facilities as the year progresses. As for Core Scientific, I’d be the last person to underestimate them. They’ve brought on some really impressive talent. I asked their CEO, Adam Sullivan, about how all their plans are coming together. He said that there are a lot of people in the existing data center world whose employees are seeing limited growth trajectories. So, if you’re an employee at one of those companies and you get an offer from Core Scientific with stock options, you’re thinking, “My current options are priced in double digits, but this could go to high double digits or even triple digits.” That’s how they’ve been able to attract such great talent. On the other hand, these new B200 chips they are using are so much more powerful but also significantly more complex, and this might play into delays for CoreWeave’s implementation at Core Scientific’s sites. I think a lot of that will come out in Core Scientific’s next earnings call in March. They’ll likely address whether they’re still on track to energize the first large CoreWeave facility in the second quarter and how they’ve tackled these networking challenges. Do you think the greater upside of AI/HPC pushes bitcoin mining to the fringes, or can it coexist alongside HPC and AI? I don’t think bitcoin mining is going away. The concept of a hybrid AI-bitcoin mining data center is interesting. HPC power usage isn’t as consistent as people might assume. It doesn’t run 24/7/365. It depends on what’s happening — are they running a new model? Are they supporting  inference ? Those power loads will fluctuate. It’s not too hard to imagine a host having flexibility in their power purchase agreements (PPAs) to run bitcoin miners when the power isn’t needed for HPC. It’s just a matter of adjusting the load. When you step back, it seems to me there’s room for both. We’ve talked about Corsicana, but there are plenty of other sites like those in West Texas. Mike Novogratz wants to turn Helios into an HPC center, but it’s in the middle of nowhere. You need a private plane to get there, and it’s a long drive from Lubbock. Also, it’s on wind power, so the energy is cheap, but how are you going to run inference from that site? What’s really interesting when you look at business models is the optionality. From the hybrid perspective, you’ve got transparency. You can forecast HPC revenue and assume a certain amount of debt based on those margins. But if you keep bitcoin mining running as well, you have the opportunity to benefit from a rising bitcoin price and improving market dynamics. I think that optionality is an opportunity some of these newer HPC-focused companies offer investors. You’ve got that steady HPC stream, and then you have the potential upside of Bitcoin hitting $200,000 this year. That’s the intriguing proposition. For that reason, I think many of these companies with experience in both will continue to do both.",14:26,14:26,en,20250225,"AI Is Here, but That Doesn’t Mean Bitcoin Miners Are Finished: Blockspace",14:26,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/02/24/ai-is-here-but-that-doesn-t-mean-bitcoin-miners-are-finished-blockspace,"AI Is Here, but That Doesn’t Mean Bitcoin Miners Are Finished: Blockspace",CoinDesk,"bitcoin-mining,ai,riot-blockchain,bit-digital,core-scientific",article_page,colin-harper,metered

There are several catalysts for the swoon, including risk-off sentiment in traditional markets and influence from memecoins, especially the recent trading in TRUMP and LIBRA.

See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . As we  discussed Monday , market makers attending the Consensus Hong Kong conference last week were worried the memecoin frenzy had sucked liquidity from the productive crypto sub-sectors, leaving the broad market vulnerable. Another reason is President Donald Trump's inaction. Although he made significant promises in the lead-up to the elections, concrete action has been scarce. The anticipated strategic BTC reserve remains absent, and even state-level reserves are proving challenging to implement. ""The industry is still waiting for this to manifest in a tangible way in the form of measures such as a mooted Bitcoin Strategic Reserve,"" Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO at Mercuryo told CoinDesk. ""In the meantime, sentiment has been hit hard by the biggest ever hack at the Bybit exchange, leaking 401,000 ETH, and a memecoin sector plagued with high-profile pump and dump schemes."" Lastly, renewed concerns about the U.S. economy are zapping demand for riskier assets. ""There is also some concern about the slowdown in U.S. growth since last week's U.S. Services PMI release, the lowest in 22 months and consistent with GDP growth tracking at 0.6% only,"" Nansen's principal research analyst Aurelie Barthere said. ""Our Nansen Risk Barometer also just turned Risk-off from Neutral today."" Together, they sent BTC diving out of its two-month-long range play between $90,000 and $110,000. Technical analysis theory suggests it could drop to $70,000, though the maximum open interest in BTC put options listed on Deribit sits at the $80,000 strike, indicating that this level could provide some support. What could stabilize prices? Perhaps an announcement from Trump regarding a strategic reserve or a sharp reversal by the Nasdaq 100. However, that index has fallen below its 50-day SMA, while the yen, a risk-aversion signal, continues to strengthen against G7 currencies, including the dollar. The next major catalysts for risk assets are Nvidia's earnings on Feb. 26 and core PCE inflation on Feb. 28. Stay alert!

(DEXTools)   The scam started with the account “Comune Guardiagrele,” a small Italian city with a verified grey checkmark indicating it’s an official government or organization account, based on web results on identity verification. Scammers probably hijacked or bought the account and changed the name to “@SBF_Doge"" mimicking Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the disgraced crypto mogul jailed for the FTX fraud. The account then launched a memecoin, likely tricking unsuspecting traders or bots into thinking it was legitimate due to the verification badge. The memecoin’s market capitalization rose to $10 million before its creators pulled liquidity, crashing it to a $100,000 capitalization and pocketing fees and proceeds gained from the sale. Derivatives Positioning The top 25 cryptocurrencies by market value, excluding stablecoins, have registered price losses in the past 24 hours.

While evidence of dip demand on Kraken is an encouraging sign for the bulls, the long-short ratio remains below 1, meaning there are still more shorts than longs on the exchange. ""While this [record long-short ratio] speaks to the underlying positive sentiment in the market, liquidations are still at relatively normal levels, meaning that there may still be excess leverage in the system.

On Tuesday, bitcoin broke out of its three-month channel, falling below $90,000 and  sliding to as low as $88,250 . According to Velo data, the bitcoin CME annualized basis — the difference between the spot price and futures — has dropped to 4%. This is the lowest since the ETFs started trading in January 2024. This is also known as the cash-and-carry trade, which is a market-neutral strategy that seeks to profit from the mispricing between the two markets.  The strategy involves taking a long position in the spot market and a short position in the futures market. Velo data shows a one-month futures forward contract. Investors collect a premium between the spread of the spot and futures pricing until the futures contract expiry date closes. At the current level, the basis trade is less than the so-called risk-free rate, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury of 5%. The difference may persuade investors to close their positions in favor of the greater return. That could see further outflows from the ETFs. Because this is a neutral strategy, investors will also have to close their short position in the futures market. Arthur Hayes , the co-founder of Bitmex, alludes to the basis trade unravelling in a post on X. ""Lots of IBIT holders are hedge funds that went long ETF short CME future to earn a yield greater than where they fund, short term US treasuries,"" he wrote.

""A nationwide reserve strategy—potentially backed by a bond issuance or a partial sale of U.S. gold reserves—could be a more viable path for future adoption,"" Fournier added.

Bankman-Fried, who was  convicted on seven different counts of fraud and conspiracy  in November 2023, is serving out  a 25-year prison sentence . He's currently detained in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn as his lawyers  work through an appeal  of his conviction. Still, his account on X (formerly Twitter) posted a 10-tweet thread about layoffs, seemingly referencing Elon Musk's push to have federal employees email their work activities from the past week or risk resignations. ""I have a lot of sympathy for [government] employees: I, too, have not checked my email for the past few (hundred) days,""  his thread began . FTT, the token associated with FTX, briefly spiked from roughly $1.55 to $2.07 after his tweets before falling back to around $1.78, according to  CoinGecko . 2) Firing people is one of the hardest things to do in the world. It sucks for everyone involved. My experience: a) it is usually not the employee’s fault that they got fired b) it is usually correct to let them go anyway — SBF (@SBF_FTX)  February 25, 2025   Bankman-Fried does not have direct access to sites like X or email, but can send messages through the Corrlinks system, which lets prisoners in the U.S. communicate with others, a person familiar confirmed. It was not immediately clear who might be posting the tweets on Bankman-Fried's behalf. Over the weekend , Musk, who according to court documents is a special government employee, tweeted that federal employees would have to tell the Office of Personnel and Management what they did last week, with a non-response being considered a resignation. While some federal agency heads or other leaders told their employees not to respond, others said their employees should reply. It's another step in Musk's efforts to lay off broad swaths of the federal workforce at the behest of U.S. President Donald Trump. Bankman-Fried's tweets referenced layoffs and detailed circumstances that might cause an employer to fire employees. 5) Maybe we just didn’t really have anyone free to manage them right then. Maybe they worked best remotely, but our company communicated in-person. Maybe they wanted to work on a particular project, and it just wasn’t what the company needed. — SBF (@SBF_FTX)  February 25, 2025   ""It isn’t the employee’s fault, when that happens. It isn’t their fault if their employer doesn’t really know what to do with them, or doesn’t really have anyone to effectively manage them. It isn’t their fault if internal politics lead their department to lose its way,""  the thread said . After Bankman-Fried's tweets,  another X account  claiming without evidence to be him linked a contract address, claiming he received a pardon from Trump and now works for DOGE, the government entity that may or may not be led by Elon Musk. The linked token saw some immediate trading volume, according to  on-chain data . The new, seemingly fake account has a label saying ""it is a government or multilateral organization account,"" suggesting a government agency account may have been compromised and renamed.

20250225,web3,A Raydium contributor doubts the memecoin factory could replicate its success.,,News,20250225,6f135148-9ebd-48fa-ba48-0cf1405e57c1,,"Solana's dominant automated market maker (AMM) Raydium hit back Monday on rumors that major volume driver Pump.Fun was preparing to launch its own AMM. Story continues Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Protocol Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . Abandoning Raydium whole hog would be a ""strategic miscalculation"" for the massively popular — and profitable — memecoin factory, core contributor InfraRAY said in a post on X. He cast doubt on the notion that Pump.Fun could replicate its success if it swaps Raydium out for in-house trading infrastructure. Token investors dumped RAY en-masse this weekend after hawkeyed observers noticed Pump.Fun was apparently testing its own AMM, presumably with the intent to replace Raydium's longstanding liquidity pools as its platform of choice. Such a move would shake up the economics of decentralized token trading on Solana. Right now, Raydium, the chain's largest AMM platform, captures trading fees generated by Pump.Fun memecoins that ""graduated"" from the launchpad to its own pools. The arrangement — in place since Pump.Fun's earliest days — has been a financial boon for Raydium But it also leaves Pump.Fun out of the long-term upside of the tokens its users create. That's not to say it's making nothing: Pump.Fun has amassed half a billion dollars on the fees it collects from early-stage token launches, one of crypto's grandest warchest. Raydium is currently generating over $1 million in fees every day from trading across all its liquidity pools, not just those of Pump.fun tokens. That said, over 30% of Raydium's daily trading volume comes from Pump.fun tokens,  according to a Dune dashboard,  meaning a good share of its fees could dry up if Pump.Fun switches away. ""100%, revenue hit is real,"" InfraRAY said in a message to CoinDesk. But he cautioned that the market's 30% haircut on RAY tokens was ""overblown"" and partially due to SOL's own weakness. He said any pivot to a new AMM could hit myriad issues: inadequate supporting infrastructure, low demand for migrated tokens, a flop on volume at launch. ""I think that’s a real risk they are overlooking but I could be wrong,"" InfraRAY said.

A spokesperson for SDNY did not return CoinDesk’s request for comment before press time, and no further details about the seizure or any related investigation were immediately available. Uranium Finance was essentially a clone of automated market maker (AMM) Uniswap deployed on Binance’s BNB chain (then called Binance Smart Chain).

Story continues Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Protocol Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . Pectra was activated on the Holesky testnet at 21:55 UTC (4:55 p.m. ET), but did not initially finalize  according to blockchain data . Finality is the state in which, once a transaction is confirmed and added to a block, it is immutable and cannot be reversed. A testnet is a network that copies a main blockchain (in this case Ethereum), and is used to test upgrades or new code before it goes to the main network. It is not immediately clear why the Pectra upgrade did not finalize on Holesky. Ethereum developers were discussing Monday over the Eth R&D Discord channel what the issue could be. This is not the first time an upgrade has not finalized on an Etheruem test network. In January 2024, when the developers were testing the Dencun upgrade,  the hard fork did not initially finalize  on the Goerli testnet. What is Pectra? The Pectra hard fork combines together  11 major upgrades , or ""Ethereum improvement proposals"" (EIPs), into one package. At the heart of this is EIP-7702, which is supposed to improve the user-experience of crypto wallets. The proposal, which was scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in  just 22 minutes , will allow wallets to have some smart contract capabilities, as part of a broader strategy to bring  account abstraction to Ethereum — a concept that makes the usability of wallets a lot less clunky. Another key proposal, EIP-7251, will allow validators  to increase the maximum amount they can stake  from 32 to 2,048 ETH. The proposal is supposed to ease some of the technicalities that validators who  stake ETH  face today: Those that stake more than their 32 ETH have to spread that across multiple validators, making the process a bit of a nuisance. By lifting the maximum stake limit and combining those validators, it could speed up the process of setting up new nodes. Holesky is the first of two testnets to run through a simulation of Pectra. The next test is supposed to occur on the Sepolia testnet on Mar. 5. But  according to  Christine Kim, a Vice President of Research at Galaxy, developers could delay it depending on the scale of today's issue. After Pectra goes live on both testnets, developers will ink in a final date to activate the upgrade on mainnet. Pectra  was originally on track to be  Ethereum’s biggest upgrade to date, and it's the first big change to the blockchain in  almost a year . Developers decided that Pectra was too ambitious, and they  agreed to split  the original package into two.

Following last week's major declines, an attempted rally by the major U.S. stock averages failed Monday afternoon, with the Nasdaq closing down another 1.2% and the S&P 500 0.5%. The worst performer among the major cryptos was solana's (SOL), down nearly 10% over the past 24 hours and a whopping 41% over the past month. In addition to its role in what appears to be a fading memecoin craze, SOL is also facing token unlocks in March and a 30% increase in SOL inflation due to the recent implementation of SIMD-96, which adjusted the network’s fee structure. At $151 at press time, SOL has now more than given up its post-election gains. “Trying to communicate to folks who may be feeling complacency/denial that $95,000 is still not a bad exit price relative to where I think we could trade in 6-12 months,” Quinn Thompson, founder of Lekker Capital, a crypto hedge fund that specializes in using macroeconomic data for its trades,  posted  on social media. Thompson estimated that there was an 80% chance that bitcoin won’t make new highs over the next three months and a 51% chance we won't see new highs for even the next 12 months. Turning to the U.S. economy, Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research,  said that  risks to the labor market are growing. Real incomes are slowing down, the housing market is getting worse, state and local governments are pulling back on spending. Worryingly, market consensus sees no economic slowdown in sight, with GDP median forecast at roughly 2.5%. “If 2023 was about being surprised to the upside, there is more risk in 2025 of being surprised to the downside,” Dutta wrote. “A passive tightening of monetary policy is the dominant risk and that has important implications for financial market investors,"" Dutta continued.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . “From the outset, we were designed and built for institutions for exactly what’s happening right now,” EDX Markets CEO Tony Acuña-Rohter, told CoinDesk. Acuña-Rohter was appointed CEO of the exchange in December after founder and then-CEO Jamil Nazarali moved to the position of executive chair of the EDX Board. “We were quite fortunate because FTX happened, crypto winter followed, which gave us two years to build out our technology,"" said Acuña-Rohter. “Now we have this company that’s ready to absorb all the new entrants from traditional finance.” The newly listed tokens include AAVE (Aave), BCH (Bitcoin Cash), COMP (Compound), LINK (Chainlink), PEPE (Pepecoin), SOL (Solana), UNI (Uniswap), USDC (USD Coin), WIF (Dogwifhat), XRP (Ripple), AVAX (Avalanche), ADA (Cardano), BONK (Bonk Coin), Stellar Lumens (XLM), TRUMP (Trump Coin), XTZ (Tezos), ETC (Ethereum Classic). “We tend to be very conservative from a regulatory perspective and because we are focused on institutions, we also make sure that we have very clear processes, policies and procedures,” saidAcuña-Rohter. The risk of adding the new tokens decreased significantly with the new administration, which is very focused on providing clarity rather than enforcing actions against crypto companies, he added. The exchange, which is available to institutions only, launched in the U.S. in June 2023 and made headlines with investments from major Wall Street firms Fidelity, Schwab, Paradigm, Sequoia Capital and Citadel, the latter being a former employer of Nazarali. One key difference between EDX Markets and other crypto exchanges is that it doesn’t hold customers' digital assets. Instead, users trade through financial intermediaries, much like how transactions occur on traditional stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. This structure appeals to regulators, EDX CEO Jamil Nazarali explained in a  previous interview , as it ensures a clear separation between the exchange and broker-dealer functions. However, EDX Markets kept its asset offerings low for the past two years, sticking to bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), and litecoin (LTC) and only recently adding Shiba Inn (SHIB) and dogecoin (DOGE) in November of last year. By integrating a basket of new assets, the exchange hopes to grow its client base and be a one-stop-shop for clients, globally. The company also plans to introduce a perpetual futures exchange in the second quarter of this year, which will be based out of Singapore but available to jurisdictions all around the world that allow the trading of perpetual futures. This doesn’t include the U.S. In the U.S., where the company is based, EDX continues to be focused on expanding its product offerings and onboarding clients from the traditional financial world, said Acuña-Rohter, noting the company is already working with various clients to solidify their plans and map out their integrations in the space. “This is the moment we’ve been waiting for,” he said.

Founder Guy Young  said in a blog post in January  that Ethena has plans to roll out iUSDe, a token tailored to regulated financial institutions.  Known as a synthetic stablecoin, USDe differs from other tokens in that it is not backed 1:1 by fiat assets. Instead, it maintains its peg by collateralizing stablecoins and taking futures positions with large open interest. USDe's market cap has jumped to around $6 billion this month, becoming the third largest stablecoin behind Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, which are worth $142 billion and $57 billion respectively. Some observers see USDe as  a potential safe heaven during periods of greater  volatility  in the wider crypto market .

See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . Perpetual funding rates for both are positive, indicating a bias for long positions that benefit from price rises. Bitcoin options trading on Deribit show a bullish bias for call options across all time frames, while those tied to ether show a downside bias into March. The bias for ether puts, however, has been present since well before the hack. Meanwhile, Volmex Finance's 30-day bitcoin implied volatility index has dropped to an annualized 48.45%, the lowest since July, according to charting platform TradingView. Ether's implied volatility has reversed the minor weekend spike from 67% to 70%. The calm is a sign of market maturity, according to QCP Capital. ""The price action underscores the growing maturity of the crypto landscape since the FTX collapse in 2022, particularly in the crypto credit market,"" the trading firm said. ""Every facet of crypto — from custodial and security solutions to corporate governance and transparency — has strengthened with each past crisis."" Overall, the crypto community is reassured by Bybit’s ability  to manage  over $6 billion in withdrawals following the hack. Plus, the exchange has  filled the gap  in its ETH reserves. According to Mena Theodorou, a co-founder of crypto exchange Coinstash, all eyes will be on Solana's SOL as Franklin Templeton, one of the world’s largest asset management firms,  has submitted  a spot SOL ETF proposal to the SEC. In addition, 11.2 million SOL (2.3% of total supply) from the FTX estate are scheduled to be unlocked on March 1, which could breed market volatility. That has already  boosted volume in SOL put options  on Deribit. President Donald Trump's  decision to audit gold reserves  at Fort Knox in Kentucky has piqued interest in the crypto community. ""While routine gold audits are rare, the timing is notable as Trump continues to push a pro-crypto narrative. If the gold supply turns out to be lower than expected, it could reinforce Bitcoin’s case as digital gold — and possibly even as a superior reserve asset,"" Theodorou said in an email. In traditional markets, the yen continues to gain ground against the U.S. dollar and growth-sensitive commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar, calling for caution on the part of the risk asset bulls.

Pump.fun linked a token called “QinShinhuang (500000)” to the hacker(s) after a 60 SOL transfer and  removed the token  from its front end to prevent this type of activity. Pump.fun could meanwhile soon  launch its own automated market maker (AMM)  in a blow to popular Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium, which benefited from being the platform graduating Pump.fun tokens traded on. Derivatives Positioning SOL put options expiring this Friday on Deribit trade at a premium of 7 vol points to calls, reflecting strong downside fears.  Ether options continue to show concerns of downside risk until the end of March, with subsequent expiries reflecting a bullish positioning. BTC options are biased bullish across time frames.  BTC block flows on Deribit featured calendar spreads and a bull call spread. ETH flows included long positions in calls at strikes of $2,850 and $2,900 and a short strangle in the April expiry.  Funding rates in perpetual futures linked to the OM token remain negative, a sign of traders taking protective bearish bets as the spot price continues to hit record highs.

20250224,markets,Attendees at Consensus saw memecoins as net negative for the broader market. Some expected the SEC to approve ETFs tied to top altcoins.,18:34,News,20250224,92a02837-52bb-46e1-a558-24d90f6ffbe4,20250224,"Bitcoin's (BTC) recent narrow price range between $94,000 and $100,000 has perplexed many market participants. While the largest cryptocurrency historically shows strong directional moves followed by months-long consolidations, known as stair-step price movements, this time feels different. Usually consolidations are followed by a breakout. In contrast, now the range has narrowed. In December it was $90,000-$110,000.  STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . Attendees at last week’s Consensus Hong Kong shared the sentiment, with some prominent market makers and industry figures suggesting the rampant memecoin frenzy is a key reason behind the lull in BTC and the broader altcoin market, which feels similar to the lackluster price action from seven years ago. ""The market has been very  saturated with memecoin launches , and crypto natives are kind of exhausted by this,"" said Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO of leading market maker Wintermute, at the conference. Tokens such as President Donald Trump's TRUMP and the LIBRA token promoted by Argentine President Javier Milei tend to draw liquidity from more established cryptocurrencies, Gaevoy said, with traders buying those at the expense of other coins. Such stagnant BTC price behavior is reminiscent of September-October 2018, when the range tightened over successive weeks, ultimately settling between $6,000 and $6,400. It's not a totally parallel situation, though. That occurred during a bear market, following a steep decline from bitcoin's then-record high of nearly $20,000, making the range play somewhat justifiable as investor confidence waned. This time around, BTC is only about 12% below its all-time high. Presidential memecoins Three days before his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump debuted his official token, TRUMP, which reached a market cap of over $12 billion in just 48 hours. Its descent was equally fast, and the market cap had crashed to near $3 billion by early this month, data from  Coingecko show . What's interesting is that the total crypto market capitalization  remained largely unchanged  at nearly $3.5 trillion during the boom-bust cycle. That's a sign the memecoin did little to draw new capital to the  market. In other words, the money simply migrated from BTC, Solana's SOL and other coins. Moreover, while some wallets that invested early made big money, around 800,000  lost a total of $2 billion  by selling at a loss or holding as prices crashed, according to Chainalysis. Something similar played out during the LIBRA fiasco early this month, which  destroyed $251 million in investor money  and became a net wealth-destroyer for the crypto market. That's probably why Abraxas Capital Management founder  Fabio Frontini said   memecoins should be banned. He was speaking during a rapid-fire round at the ""Views from Wall Street to Crypto"" session at Consensus. Jason Atkins, chief commercial officer at Auros, said the fact that memecoins are sucking out liquidity from the other sectors of the market shows how fragile the liquidity pool is. ""It's clear that adoption is still at an early stage,"" Atkins said in an interview. ""The number of participants remains relatively low, and the fact that one high-profile token launch can send shockwaves across the entire market shows how fragile the liquidity pool is. It's a clear signal that the broader market lacks sufficient depth and stability."" Those are key requirements for attracting more institutional interest, he said. ""Institutional investors are actively exploring how they can engage with this space. But they are cautious. They need to see a more mature, stable market that can handle larger volumes without getting disrupted by speculative, meme-driven activity."" Bitcoin's direction Opinions were mixed on what happens next for the BTC price.  Several Consensus delegates said the meme frenzy and the uncanny stability in BTC is unhealthy. Such range plays often end with a downside move, they said. That's what happened in 2018, when the consolidation ended with a sharp decline.  On the other hand, the memecoin saturation is  overshadowing positive news  on the regulatory front, Wintermute's Gaevoy said. ""People don't necessarily appreciate that we have a lot of positive news coming. For example, on the regulatory side, we have all forgotten how bad of an influence the SEC and even CFTC was for the last few years and now that overhang is completely gone. I don't think it's being properly priced, So I'm pretty optimistic,"" Gaevoy said. Altcoin ETFs? The regulatory environment includes change of U.S. administration and exit of Gary Gensler from the Securities and Exchange Commission.  A number of issuers have now filed SEC applications for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to Solana's SOL, XRP, dogecoin (DOGE) and litecoin (LTC). To date, the regulator has approved only spot bitcoin and ether ETFs, assuming that the CME's surveillance system for bitcoin and ether futures mitigates concerns about price manipulation. If CME futures  are seen as a prerequisite to win approval for ETFs tied to digital assets, it's worth noting the broader altcoins don't have that privilege yet. Gaevoy disagrees. ""It's a relic from the previous SEC leadership. I would definitely not be surprised if Solana and other top 10 tokens excluding stablecoins are approved,"" he said.",11:42,11:42,en,20250224,"Consensus Hong Kong Review: TRUMP, LIBRA Memecoins Under Fire as Dormant BTC Revives Memories of 2018",11:42,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/02/24/memecoins-under-fire-as-btc-lullfest-below-usd100k-revives-memories-of-2018,"Consensus Hong Kong Review: TRUMP, LIBRA Memecoins Under Fire as Dormant BTC Revives Memories of 2018",CoinDesk,"bitcoin,trump,libra,memecoins,markets",article_page,omkar-godbole,metered

Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today .

Mark Foster, European Union policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation, expects that the Centre Right Alliance will likely support the European Union's approach to digital innovation, he told CoinDesk in an interview ahead of the election. ""So I don't expect a massive change overnight from the previous government to the new government in terms of either digital assets policy or digital euro, but perhaps an openness and a willingness to think about how these solutions can possibly help improve the competitiveness of the German and the European economy and bring in some jobs and growth in competition, which is clearly the overarching principle at the moment and priority for the European Commission,"" Foster said. Germany's election so far has had little impact on crypto. The country, which is the European Union's largest economy, called an early election after its coalition between the Social Democrats (SDP), Free Democratic party (FDP) and Greens  collapsed in November .

However, there has been no public announcement yet.   AMM is a exchange system in crypto markets that makes trading easy by using a liquidity pool of usually, and at least, two tokens. Instead of matching buyers and sellers like a traditional exchange, smart contracts set the prices based on supply and demand and allow trades to be processed without a counterparty.

The “amm.pump.fun” shows a swap product in the making with a sell and buy option alongside a deposit and withdrawal function. That’s a first for Pump.Fun, which lets anyone issue a token for less than $2 in capital, after which they choose the number of tokens, theme, and meme picture to accompany it. When the market capitalization of any token reaches $69,000, a portion of liquidity is deposited to the Solana-based exchange Raydium and burned (or when tokens are taken out of supply permanently). Pump.Fun’s own AMM would mean tokens are no longer migrated to Raydium, or at least that’s what the market thinks, dampening sentiment for the latter’s RAY tokens. RAY is down 25% in the past 24 hours on the apparent development. “It seems they are planning to have pump tokens graduate to their own pools instead of Raydium,” trader @trenchdiver101, who first flagged the development, said. “They can either extract more fees on Solana or have some mechanism to reward token holders.” Though a part of Raydium's total trading activity is derived from Pump.Fun tokens, the exchange supports several other top markets — such as Solana (SOL) to stablecoins and others — contributing to  its $500 million  in average daily trading volumes. As such, the product could further bump the revenues and profits of Pump.Fun, which has no token but is among the most profitable crypto applications in the past year — a rare feat in a market where businesses heavily rely on token sales to generate income.

Last week, SOL block trades totaling $32.39 million in notional value crossed the tape on Deribit, representing nearly 25% of the total options activity of $130.74 million. The remainder of the activity comprised screen trades, according to Amberdata. That's the second-highest proportion of block trades to total activity on record.

A ""block trade"" in options refers to a significant, privately negotiated options transaction between two parties involving a large number of contracts. Such trades, typically associated with whale activity, are executed over-the-counter and outside the regular order book and then booked on the exchange, allowing for a minimal impact on the market prices. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset, in this case, SOL, at a preset price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while a put option provides the right to sell. On Deribit, which accounts for over 85% of the global crypto options activity, one options contract represents 1 SOL. Last week's spike in SOL block trades featured a preference for put options, which traders use to hedge against or profit from a potential price slide. ""Nearly 80% of the block-trade volume was concentrated in put contracts. Compared to only 40% puts for BTC and 37.5% puts for ETH during the same timeframe,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said. SOL options: Weekly volume in block trades and screen trades. (Amberdata/Deribit)   The whale demand for put options comes as SOL's outlook appears grim following the 46% price slide to $160 in just over five weeks. The activity on the Solana blockchain, which became a go-to-place for memecoin traders last year, peaked with the launch of the TRUMP token on Jan. 17, three days before Donald Trump was inaugurated as the President of the U.S. Since then, the number of daily transactions on Solana and the cumulative daily volume on the Solana-based decentralized exchanges has declined significantly, according to data source Artemis. That has weakened the bullish case for SOL. Solana: Daily transactions and DEX volume.

""Solana (SOL) will have a major token unlock event on March 1, releasing 11.2 million SOL tokens, valued at approximately $2.07 billion. This represents 2.29% of the total supply. A significant portion of the unlock comes from the FTX estate and a foundation sale,"" Chen said. Chen explained that the large unlock could breed market volatility as it accounts for nearly 59% of SOL's daily spot trading volume. Hence, its natural to see a lot of hedging flow in put options in anticipation of a potential extended SOL price slide.

Friday’s attack targeted one of Bybit’s offline “cold” wallets, which are typically considered secure due to their lack of internet connectivity, in a heist that allowed $1.4 billion in ETH to be withdrawn. Hackers gained control by exploiting a sophisticated method involving a manipulated user interface (UI) and URL. This allowed the attackers to alter the smart contract logic, redirecting the funds to an unidentified address. The stolen assets were then split across multiple wallets and swapped on decentralized exchanges. Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT linked the hack to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored hacking collective notorious for crypto thefts.

Following the hack, Arthur Hayes, BitMEX co-founder and claiming to be a major ether (ETH) holder,  wrote a post  on X to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin on whether he will “advocate to roll back the chain to help @Bybit_Official.” Meanwhile, in an X spaces session, Bybit’s CEO Ben Zhou revealed that his team had also  reached out  to the Ethereum Foundation to see if it was something the network would consider, noting that such a decision should be based on what the network's community wants. Hayes's post immediately provoked a fierce reaction from the Ethereum community, which was firm in its belief that it wouldn't happen. Some even questioned whether the BitMEX founder was joking. CoinDesk reached out to Hayes over X to clarify his comments. Ethereum members, like the core developer teams, are vastly against “rolling back” the network because it would override core elements of decentralization. If Buterin decided on his own that it would happen, then that would be seen as the end of Ethereum’s ethos, which heavily involves various developer teams and other community members when it comes to the health and state of the blockchain. “Rolling back the chain would give ETH no purpose. What's the point if you can just change rules,” said user @the_weso  in a post on X . Some  outside the  Ethereum community pointed  to the 2016 DAO hack as an example  when $60 million in ETH was stolen. The network went forward with a hard fork, splitting the old network into two, and the new chain continued on as Ethereum. That hard fork was not a “rollback,” though; it was known as an “irregular state transition.” Ethereum technically can’t “roll back” the network because it relies on an account model, where accounts hold users' ETH. At the time of the hack, developers upgraded their nodes to a new client or software. Those who didn’t upgrade their nodes were still on the old chain, which became known as Ethereum Classic. When the nodes upgraded to the new software, the stolen ETH could move from one Ethereum account address to the next. “The 'irregular state change' that they implemented at the time of the DAO hard fork was this: they airlifted all the ETH in the DAO smart contracts out to a refund contract that would send you 1 ETH for every 100 DAO tokens you sent in,” wrote Laura Shin of Unchained i n a post on X .

The exchange is now looking to understand exactly what happened. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Long & Short Newsletter today .

In an X spaces session, Bybit’s CEO Ben Zhou revealed that shortly after the incident, he called for “all hands on deck” to serve their clients with processing withdrawals and responding to inquiries about what was going on. During the session, Zhou revealed that the security breach saw the hackers make off with roughly 70% of their clients’ ether, which meant that Bybit needed to quickly secure a loan to be able to process withdrawals. Yet, Zhou found that ether wasn’t the most withdrawn token, with most users instead withdrawing stablecoin from Bybit. The exchange, Zhou noted, has reserves to cover these withdrawals, but the crisis deepened as, in response to the incident, Safe moved to temporarily shut down its smart wallet functionalities to “ensure absolute confidence in our platform’s security.” Safe is a decentralized custody protocol providing smart contract wallets for digital asset management. Some exchanges integrated Safe, which allows users to maintain custody of their funds and has multisig functionality to enhance the security of their cold wallets. Total value on Bybit's wallets (DeFiLlama)   While the exchange had reserves to back up users’ withdrawals, $3 billion worth of USDT was in a Safe wallet that had just been shut down as the wallet moved to understand the situation, according to Zhou.  On social media, Safe said that while it had ""not found evidence that the official Safe frontend was compromised,"" it was temporarily  shutting down ""certain functionalities""  out of caution. While Zhou and Bybit’s team were figuring out how to securely withdraw their $3 billion, withdrawals were mounting. Within two hours of the security breach, the exchange was facing requests to move over $100,000 off its platform, Zhou revealed. Responding to the situation, Zhou told his security team to engage Safe to “find a better way to get this money out.” The team ended up developing new software with code “based on Etherscan” to verify the signatures “on a very manual level” to move the stablecoins back to their wallet and cover the withdrawal surge. The exchange’s team had to remain up all night to be able to fulfill withdrawals, according to Zhou. As the exchange managed to move the $3 billion in stablecoin reserves, it was facing a bank run of “about 50%” of all the funds within the exchange. Zhou said that since the incident, the exchange has moved a significant amount of funds off of Safe cold wallets and is now determining what system it will use to replace Safe. Pushing to ""Roll Back"" Ethereum Was not Off the Table Since the security breach, Bybit has engaged authorities. During the session, Zhou said that the Singaporean authorities took the issue “very seriously” and that he believes it has already been escalated with Interpol. Blockchain analysis firms, including Chainalysis, were engaged. Zhou said, “As long as Bybit is there and continues to track [the stolen ether], I hope we can get these funds back.” Notably, he revealed that pushing to ""roll back"" the Ethereum blockchain, which was suggested by some industry players on social media, including BitMEX co-founder  Arthur Hayes , had been on the table for some time if the community agreed with it. “I had my team talking to Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation to see if there’s any recommendations they can offer to help. I do really thank all these guys on Twitter asking if there is a possibility to roll back the chain. I’m not sure what was the response on their side, but anything that would help we would try,” Zhou said. When asked if ""rolling back"" the chain   is even possible, Zhou responded he doesn’t know. “I’m not sure it’s a one-man decision based on the spirit of blockchain. It should be a work in process to see what the community wants,” he said. It's worth noting that a blockchain ""rollback"" refers to a state change that would allow for the funds to be recovered. While rolling back the Bitcoin blockchain is technically possible, such a state change on Ethereum would be more complex, given its smart contract interactions and state-based architecture.  Nevertheless, any state change would require consensus and likely lead to a contentious hard fork, drawing criticism from the community. This would likely  split  the Ethereum blockchain into two networks, each with its own supporters. As for what exactly caused the hack to occur, is still unclear. Per Zhou, Bybit’s laptops have not been compromised. He said the movements of the transaction’s signers have been scrutinized but appear to have been routine. “We know the cause is definitely around the Safe cold wallet. Whether it’s a problem with our laptops or on Safe’s side, we don’t know.,” Zhou added.",19:56,19:57,en,20250222,Bybit Sees Over $4 Billion ‘Bank Run’ After Crypto’s Biggest Hack,19:56,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/02/22/bybit-sees-over-usd4-billion-bank-run-after-crypto-s-biggest-hack,Bybit Sees Over $4 Billion ‘Bank Run’ After Crypto’s Biggest Hack,CoinDesk,"bybit,ethereum,hack,bank-run",article_page,francisco-rodrigues,metered

Also removed the percentage of ETH held by hackers in 2016). Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and major ether (ETH) holder, asked Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin if he would be willing to entertain the idea of rolling back the network to assist hacked exchange Bybit, which lost nearly $1.4 billion in ether (ETH) on Friday.

""My own view as a mega $ETH bag holder is $ETH stopped being money in 2016 after the DAO hack hardfork. If the community wanted to do it again, I would support it because we already voted no on immutability in 2016 [wh]y not do it again?"" he added  Buterin was yet to reply as of time of publication.   While some, including  Unchained's Laura Shin , wondered if Hayes's post was a joke, it did raise a serious question about whether rolling back is even feasible. CoinDesk reached out to Hayes about the post and hasn't received a comment at the time of writing.  ""I wish we could roll back for the Bybit hack, I'm not against the idea. But the DAO hack was 15% of ETH with a clean recovery path. Today, a rollback would break bridges, stablecoins, L2s, RWAs and so much more. ETH ecosystem is just too interconnected now for a clean solution like 2016,"" said Gautham Santhosh, co-founder of Polynomial.fi. The problem with ""rollback"" Hayes' suggestions of rolling back the blockchain as one of the potential ways to address hacking involves reverting the blockchain to a state before a specific event, in this case, the hack. That way, malicious transactions resulting from the hack can be erased, effectively restoring lost or stolen funds. Implementing a rollback requires consensus from the network participants. For instance, in 2016, the Ethereum network saw a  controversial revision  of the network using a hard fork to reverse a theft of $60 million in ether from The DAO (the percentage the hackers  took control  of is still up for debate). The hard fork split the chain into two – Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.  However, the term ""rollback"" was never used during that revision; it was referred to as an “irregular state transition.” The move still triggered huge and important debates over so-called “immutability” in blockchains. Immutability is a security feature that prevents data from being changed after it's added to the blockchain, making it trustworthy and tamper-proof.  A similar controversy played out in the Bitcoin community in 2019 when Binance's CEO Changpeng Zhao and his team  considered pushing for a ""rollback"" approach  (the term was later rephrased by CZ as ""re-org"" and decided not to pursue the approach) on the Bitcoin network following a $40 million hack. However, the Bitcoin mining community  criticized  the idea of going back against the principle of decentralization and immutability. Similarly, the Ethereum community criticized the idea of ""rollback"" in this case, noting that the idea wouldn't even have been  considered  by the community. Theoretically, an actual ""rollback"" won't be possible on Ethereum, as the network uses something called "" accounts "" to store the ether, which can be analogous to bank accounts. When the 2016 hack occurred, the nodes upgraded to new software, and the ETH held was moved to new addresses. However, the idea of reversing a transaction in light of a hack isn't a new one; at least one smaller blockchain network, Vericoin, actually  executed  such a procedure previously. The Bybit hack came into light  on Friday  when on-chain sleuth ZachXBT noted suspicious outflows of over $1.4 billion from the exchange, with the attacker quickly swapping mETH and stETH for ether through a decentralized exchange. The hackers were later  identified  by ZachXBT as the North Korean Lazarus Group.  The attacker then split 10,000 ETH to 39 different addresses and another 10,000 ETH to nine addresses, Polynomial.fi's Santhosh said on X. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou  said  that the hacker ""took control of the specific ETH cold wallet and transferred all the ETH in the cold wallet to this unidentified address.""

There are multiple other reports out there…  https://t.co/gkEu2wZwfo — Ben Zhou (@benbybit)  February 20, 2025   The Pi Network didn't respond to CoinDesk's request for comments.  The token went live alongside the project's mainnet release on Thursday. Users who ""mined"" tokens by clicking their smartphone screens once a day were finally able to transfer and sell tokens.  Zhou, however, found himself in the middle of a separate issue on Friday, with his exchange Bybit, which was  hacked  by North Korea's Lazarus Group for $1.5 billion.  The PI token debuted on OKX at $0.67, rose as high as $2 and then slumped 65% and is  currently around $0.69. One issue that raised concerns was a marketing tactic that rewarded users who recruited other users. Each time a user persuaded someone else to sign up using their code, the first person's ""mining"" rewards were increased. The idea had some drawing comparisons to the  2017 Ponzi scheme, Bitconnect . ""Pi Network is the  biggest ponzi [scheme] ,"" X user CryptoBeast alleged, posting to their 656K followers.  The project also offers users the option of locking their tokens for as long as three years. In return, they are promised increased rewards. The same technique was at the heart of the Hex project, whose founder, Richard Schueler, known online as Richard Heart, is a fugitive sought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for, among other things,  defrauding his investors . The token has a market cap of $4.18 billion based on a circulating supply of $6.33 billion. However, its inflationary nature means the maximum supply is 100 billion, giving a fully diluted value (FDV) at a staggering $67 billion, assuming it holds the current price. At launch, FDV rose as high as $200 billion, almost double that of Solana. Some exchanges have been undeterred by the concerns raised. OKX, Bitget and Gate have racked up a total of $620 million in trading volume for PI trading pairs between them, according to  CoinMarketCap .

That news sent bitcoin and ether (ETH) sliding roughly 2% in a manner of minutes. Prices quickly seemed to stabilize and — at least in the case for bitcoin — bounce a bit. Et tu stocks? Any sort of bounce, however, was quickly snuffed out as modest losses for U.S. stocks began to accelerate in afternoon trading. Among the excuses for the quick retreat was a poor reading from the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, which unexpectedly slipped to 64.7 versus forecasts for 67.8. The same survey's inflation expectations rose to 3.5% against an expected 3.3%. An outlier, but perhaps also a reason for selling, was a new coronavirus scare out of China.

However, the USMS doesn’t seem to know how much crypto it currently has. In fact, the agency is struggling to come up with a rough estimate of even its bitcoin holdings, a source familiar with the matter told CoinDesk. That could be a problem, in light of White House Crypto Czar David Sacks'  announcement earlier this month  that the U.S. government is actively studying the possibility of constituting a national crypto reserve — meaning that the government might stop liquidating seized cryptocurrencies, and even potentially make crypto purchases. “When you start talking about reserves, you need to be familiar with the unique properties of the assets, like forks, airdrops, and the constant volatility,” said Les Borsai, co-founder of Wave Digital Assets, a firm that provides asset management services and has been in a dispute with the USMS over not getting hired as a contractor, in an interview with CoinDesk. “You have to have the agencies educated enough or dealing with professionals that understand how to help them achieve their goals.” Even if the crypto reserve never sees the light of day, managing and liquidating seized digital assets is a crucial role for the agency, especially since asset forfeiture is used to help fund the Department of Justice (DOJ). “As far as I'm aware, the USMS is currently managing this with individual keystrokes in an Excel spreadsheet,” Chip Borman, vice president of capture strategy and proposals at Addx Corporation, a firm that provides technological solutions to the U.S. government and was also turned down for a USMS contract, told CoinDesk. Borman said he saw USMS processes occur in real time in 2023.  “They're one bad day away from a billion-dollar mistake.” USMS history of crypto management The agency’s troubles with crypto aren’t new. Timothy Clarke, CEO of crypto consulting firm ECC Solutions, told CoinDesk that a lot of frustration had built up against the USMS from both the public and private sectors over the years. As recently as 2019, the agency “only handled a handful of cryptocurrency assets, like eight or 10, so all the different U.S. government agencies had to do their own storage, instead of the USMS doing its job and intaking seizures,” said Clarke, a former special agent at the Department of Treasury. Not only would the USMS take weeks to provide bitcoin deposit addresses to agencies when they’d just made a seizure, he said, but the agency would simply share them over email without any sort of encryption or verification process.  At other agencies, like IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), such sensitive information is usually either communicated in video calls or via read-only encrypted attachments with follow-up calls for passwords and read-back verification of the addresses — and that’s if specialists don’t come directly on-site to handle crypto wallets themselves. “It was very, very unsecure,” Clarke said. “It’s just shocking that nothing happened in the years they did that.” The USMS declined to comment. Back in 2022, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG)  warned  that the USMS was struggling in the management and tracking of its holdings. “The USMS did not have adequate policies related to seized cryptocurrency storage, quantification, valuation, and disposal, and in some instances, guidance was conflicting,” the OIG said.  For example, the USMS did not have measures in place to track forked assets — cryptocurrencies that are created whenever a blockchain does a split, known in the industry as a hard fork — think Bitcoin Cash (BCH) or Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV), both of which forked off of Bitcoin. “As a result, the USMS may fail to identify and track forked assets, and thereby lose the opportunity to sell those assets when they are forfeited,” the OIG said. The spreadsheets on which the agency was relying to track its various crypto holdings also contained inaccuracies, the OIG found. In November 2022, five months after the OIG report was published, USMS  stated  (while it was looking for a contractor to help it handle its crypto assets) that it had lost control of two Ethereum wallets due to a software update.  “It is unclear if the private key is incorrect, or the wallet malfunctioned,” the agency said. “The Contractor will identify the issue(s) and potentially open the wallet. If the wallet cannot be opened, documentation of efforts taken to unlock or open the wallet will be provided to the USG.” Clarke told CoinDesk that it was unclear whether the issues with the Ethereum wallets had occurred before, during, or after the OIG audit. The OIG report itself makes no mention of mismanaged Ethereum wallets or missing ether (ETH).  “At a minimum it speaks to a lack of a backup wallet and lack of competent storage, update, and handling procedures,” Clarke said. “The perception is that everything has remained the same since the 2022 OIG Findings,” John Millward, chief operating officer at Addx, told CoinDesk in an interview. Millward said he understood there to be a single employee managing the assets disposal “right now on a retail account,” though the agency wasn't available to confirm such details. He said the task had not been assigned to a senior employee “despite the massive financial responsibilities and liability this one person controls.” Liquidating crypto ahead of stockpile decision In July 2024, at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, President Trump said that, if elected, he would instruct the federal government to stop selling seized bitcoin. That was an idea first pushed by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), one of bitcoin's most vocal backers in Congress, who introduced legislation aimed towards constituting a national bitcoin reserve. On Jan. 15, only a few days before Trump was set to take office, Lummis wrote a letter to Ronald L. Davis — who at the time was still director of the USMS — in which she expressed her alarm that DOJ attorneys appeared to be engaged in a process to liquidate the 69,370 bitcoin (worth roughly $6.6 billion) seized from Silk Road. “Recent court filings from earlier this month show that the Department of Justice is citing bitcoin price volatility to justify an expedited sale of these assets,” she wrote.  “Even more troubling, the Department continues to aggressively push forward with liquidation plans despite pending legal challenges, demonstrating an unusual urgency to dispose of these assets,” she added. “This rushed approach, occurring during the presidential transition period, directly contradicts the incoming administration's stated policy objectives regarding the establishment of a National Bitcoin Stockpile.” Lummis asked the USMS (which handles seized assets, but does not make decisions with regards to liquidations) to share the total amount of bitcoin it currently holds, to explain why that information has not been made readily available in a public manner, and to describe its tracking and management procedures. The agency was given until Jan. 31 to answer, but has yet to formally respond, according to a source familiar with the matter. The USMS has contacted Lummis’ office twice since the letter was issued, the source said, but the agency was unable to answer how much bitcoin it had under its control, blaming the shake-up caused by the change in administrations. Lummis’ office declined to comment. Significant amounts of bitcoin are apparently being held by various agencies across the administration — including the DOJ and Department of Treasury — and the USMS has no reconciliation process to figure out where it all sits, the source said. USMS procurement struggles The OIG noted in 2022 that the USMS was taking proactive steps to boost its management procedures by seeking to enlist the private sector. The move would “assist the USMS in addressing some of the issues we identified,” the OIG said. However, the agency has taken a long time to award these contracts, and its decisions have been questioned by some of the parties involved. The USMS started looking into procurement in 2018 and first  awarded  the contract to crypto exchange Bitgo in April 2021. However, it was determined that the exchange did not meet the definition of a “small business” (which was one of the requirements for the contract). The award then  passed on  to crypto custody firm Anchorage Digital in July 2021 — yet Anchorage was also found too large to meet the small-business criteria. The agency switched gears in 2024, awarding two different contracts: the first for the management of so-called Class 1 cryptocurrencies (meaning coins supported on centralized exchanges and in cold-storage wallets) and the second for Class 2-4 cryptocurrencies (coins that don’t meet Class 1 requirements).  Crypto exchange Coinbase  won the award  for Class 1 in July, while the Class 2-4 contract went in October to Command Services & Support (CMDSS), a technology service provider with experience working with the DOJ. Controversial awarding These awards were both contested in court. Anchorage’s protest, against Coinbase, was  dismissed , but it’s unclear whether the firm has filed another protest. The U.S. government spending website  suggests  that Coinbase has yet to receive payment for the contract. (Anchorage declined to comment. Coinbase did not respond to a request for comment.) The Class 2-4 award, meanwhile, is the subject of an ongoing protest by Wave, which claims that CMDSS lacks the proper licensing for the contract — CMDSS isn’t licensed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nor the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) — and that the agency failed to properly investigate a conflict of interest from CMDSS employing a former USMS official with access to nonpublic information. The USMS, for its part, has stated that the winning bidder wasn’t required to be licensed with the SEC or FINRA in the first place; the agency also claims to have properly investigated any conflicts of interest related to former USMS employees. “If you don't care about the basics, like being licensed to handle securities, which is the most basic understanding of handling digital assets, then what are you doing? It just shows you how little they know about the process,” Borsai said. CMDSS did not respond to a request for comment. Addx competed against Wave and CMDSS for the contract. Nevertheless, Millward said that it would have made more sense for Wave than CMDSS to secure the award, since the firm possessed technical upside and offered to perform the work for a lower price. “I think there’s a lot of personal trust in the leadership of the awarded entity to figure it out and not make the USMS look bad,” Millward said. Dealing with smaller cryptocurrencies The central theme from USMS's critics is that the agency doesn't sufficiently understand digital assets. “They treat crypto like it's a boat or a piece of real estate,” Borsai said. “The USMS could not possibly understand what they hold if they do not understand the assets. … They will never get an accurate figure, unless they go all-in on a multi-agency shared system.” Millward and Borman said that the USMS had difficulty understanding that custody firms need the same amount of resources to manage a specific number of Class 2-4 coins regardless of whether the tokens are worth billions of dollars or merely cents.  The agency had suggested to Addx that if it won the award it may have been paid only in a percentage of the assets it would end up managing, instead of a flat fee. The agency seemed surprised when Addx explained how expensive the custody solutions would be. “They said, ‘We anticipate never having more than $500 in value at any given time,’” Borman said. “They don’t understand that by judge’s decree, that fob that contains 20 cents worth of bitcoin needs to be tracked and analyzed, and destroying some fellow’s 20 cents is just as egregious as crashing a Lamborghini on the way to the impound lot.”",19:03,19:03,en,20250221,"U.S. Marshals Service, Managing Billions of Seized Assets, Can't Say How Much Crypto It Holds",19:03,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/02/20/u-s-marshals-service-managing-seized-assets-can-t-say-how-much-crypto-it-holds,"U.S. Marshals Service, Managing Billions of Seized Assets, Can't Say How Much Crypto It Holds",CoinDesk,"us-marshals-service,bitcoin,department-of-justice,cynthia-lummis,bitcoin-reserve,feature,exclusive",article_page,tom-carreras,metered

20250221,opinion,A bipartisan challenge to the SEC's exclusion of staking from ETPs is an essential step to maintaining America’s competitiveness in the digital asset markets.,,Opinion,20250221,0a543919-a0a9-4590-94e0-e2172cc757ec,,"For far too long, the U.S. has been falling behind the rest of the world on staking policy. Now, in just the first 30 days of the Trump Administration, staking has been mentioned in Congressional hearings, listed as a top priority by the SEC’s newly created crypto task force and is today the focus of  a bipartisan letter  from lawmakers challenging the previous SEC’s stance on its inclusion in exchange-traded products (ETPs).   Many in the digital asset sector celebrated when the first spot ether ETFs were approved in September of last year. It was a giant leap forward for the second-largest cryptocurrency, achieving legitimacy in the eyes of U.S. regulators. But there has been one glaring omission within these financial products: the ability to stake the held assets and profit by doing so.  Now a bipartisan group of lawmakers including Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Steve Daines (R-Montana), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) is leading the way to correct that. In a letter delivered to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, they are challenging the SEC's directive to exclude protocol staking in ETPs, highlighting how this position could undermine both investor protections and the competitiveness of U.S. markets. Story continues Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Node Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . The SEC’s prohibition on staking within ETPs is based on a faulty understanding of how staking works on proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum. Staking is not an investment product in itself. Rather, it is a fundamental technical requirement for securing and validating transactions on proof-of-stake networks. When token holders stake their assets, they contribute to the network's security, and in doing so earn rewards generated by the protocol itself — not from any centralized authority. International competitiveness The SEC's directive to spot ether ETP issuers to exclude staking raises serious concerns about America's competitive position in global digital asset markets. While the United States hesitates, other major financial centers including Switzerland, Canada, Germany and Australia have embraced staking in their digital asset ETPs, recognizing its integral role in network security and operational stability. Just last month, the U.K.  issued  a statutory instrument acknowledging that arrangements for qualifying crypto asset staking do not amount to a collective investment scheme, reinforcing its importance in securing and maintaining blockchain networks. Because staking is essential for securing proof-of-stake networks, it also means that if there were no one staking their ether, then all of the assets within these ETPs would be at risk. This means that, perversely, the SEC has forced American investors into a position where their investments are only protected by assets held in other jurisdictions. Crucially, the impact of these regulations extends beyond just the Ethereum blockchain, but applies to possible future ETPs of other networks that also use proof-of-stake such as Solana, Avalanche and Polkadot. As the digital asset sector grows, the impact of this misguided regulation will only deepen. Getting this regulation wrong hurts both American investors and the U.S. economy. Either investors accept domestic products without staking and the associated rewards, limiting their financial returns, or they seek exposure through off-shore alternatives, driving capital offshore and out of U.S. stock exchanges. Without staking, ether ETP holders gradually lose their relative network ownership position due to the inflationary nature of staking rewards. This economic reality makes U.S. products less competitive and less attractive to investors seeking comprehensive exposure to the Ethereum ecosystem. Even more troubling, this outcome appears to contradict the SEC's core mission of investor protection, likely pushing investors toward investment vehicles in other jurisdictions that may not meet the investor protection standards available to investors in the U.S. The technical risks associated with staking, when managed by sophisticated validators, are minimal and well-understood. The often-cited ""slashing risk"" — a penalty mechanism for dishonest validation attempts — has affected just 0.001 percent of staked ether to date. This data suggests that the SEC's cautious stance may be disproportionate to the actual risks involved. What’s at stake As we await the SEC's response to the important questions raised by Congress, American investors continue to be at a distinct disadvantage. The path forward requires a balanced approach that recognizes staking for what it is — a technical mechanism for network security — while ensuring there is appropriate oversight when it is offered within regulated investment products. As the letter rightly points out, while only Congress can create a comprehensive regulatory framework, the SEC has the authority to permit staking in ETPs. Doing so would align with both the agency’s mandate to protect investors and the goal of maintaining U.S. leadership in global financial markets. The bipartisan Congressional letter to SEC Commissioners Uyeda and Peirce endorsing Protocol Staking in Digital Asset ETPs is a significant milestone for investors – both crypto native and institutional. With Uyeda having criticized what he has called the “weaponization” of the SEC’s enforcement functions and crypto advocate Paul Atkins being nominated to take over the role of SEC Chair, we have a rare opportunity to make progress on one of the most common sense issues in the digital asset landscape. It’s beyond time for the SEC to assume a leadership position when it comes to protocol staking, which powers the digital asset sector. This befits the aspirations of the American economy and the Americans who rely on it.",18:25,18:25,en,20250221,Why The SEC Needs to Allow Staking in Exchange-Traded Products,18:25,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/02/20/why-the-sec-needs-to-allow-staking-in-exchange-traded-products,Why The SEC Needs to Allow Staking in Exchange-Traded Products,CoinDesk,"staking,exchange-traded-products,sec,regulation",article_page,"jennie-levin, alison-mangiero",metered

The senators' letter — backed by Cynthia Lummis, the Republican chair of a Senate subcommittee that focuses on digital assets — calls for reconsidering the practice, which involves locking up digital tokens to support blockchain operations in return for rewards.

While the SEC has been making moves almost daily to reverse past positions on digital assets, the pending vote would mark a watershed moment that could start a series of legal dominoes to free other crypto businesses from enforcement actions. Because the deal between Coinbase and SEC staff assumes a dismissal of the case ""with prejudice,"" said Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, the regulator's accusations of securities violations would be shut down permanently. Story continues Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today .

""It's a great day for Coinbase, yes, but it's also a great day for crypto in America,"" Grewal said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""We have every expectation, based on representations that have been made to us, that that approval will come, and with that, the dismissal will then be filed."" He restated it in simpler terms: ""We win; they lose."" And Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in  a video posted on Friday  that ""this is an important signal about where things are going."" When the SEC  first went after Coinbase  — the most prominent of the U.S.-based crypto platforms — it represented a shot across the bow of the industry. The SEC alleged Coinbase violated federal law by not registering as a clearing house, broker or trading venue, based on the agency's view of the so-called Howey test that determines whether an asset is a security. The company chose to fight the accusations in federal court, and that legal clash had been fierce, most recently seeing a judge  side with Coinbase's effort  to elevate an appeal of the central question at dispute: Are these tokens being traded really securities under the SEC's jurisdiction? The industry had long expected it might have to wait for the courts — eventually even the U.S. Supreme Court — to rule on former SEC Chair Gary Gensler's assertion that most tokens are actually crypto securities. But the surrender of the SEC in this dispute is likely to be echoed in other cases, which would put the final word on the legal definition into the hands of Congress.  So, the commission vote could throw the industry's major focus toward lobbying instead of legal wrangling. The enforcement meetings for the SEC — currently made up of Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda, Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce and Democrat Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw — typically take place on Thursdays, so the final decision on the staff recommendation may be delayed as long as a week. Crenshaw has been a vocal skeptic of the digital assets industry and its compliance, so it remains unclear whether she'd be willing to sign off on the dismissal. An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the agreement revealed by Coinbase. SEC allies Uyeda and Peirce, who was named the head of the agency's new Crypto Task Force, had long been sympathetic to the digital assets industry's contention it was being mishandled by the SEC. Once Donald Trump was sworn in as president, he gave the agency's gavel to Uyeda on an interim basis, and Uyeda began making swift moves to shift its course on crypto. This is the latest and — assuming a yes vote — arguably the most significant of the changes so far. Eventually, former Commission Paul Atkins will take over after he secures a Senate confirmation. But Uyeda and Peirce both served Atkins as counsels during his tenure at the SEC, so Atkins is generally expected to follow the same path on crypto that Uyeda is already clearing. Earlier this week, the agency  shifted its enforcement unit  — once laser-focused on crypto — to a wider responsibility over ""emerging technologies,"" suggesting a withdrawal from the era of heavy attention on crypto cases. It also  dropped its appeal  in the fight to defend its effort to force a wide swath of crypto activity into its recent rule to expand the definition of what makes a ""dealer"" under SEC oversight. In another marquee crypto case, the regulator  recently asked to hit pause  on the Binance enforcement dispute. Those accusations of securities-law violations overlapped to some degree with the complaint against Coinbase, though the Binance suit also included  accusations of fraud and conflicts of interest . The SEC had similarly signaled last week that something was brewing with Coinbase when it  asked for a delay  in court proceedings, suggesting negotiations were underway toward a resolution and signaling the agency's new crypto task force would help the enforcement team come up with a ""potential resolution."" ""The SEC’s unilateral surrender in its lawsuit against Coinbase is a historic mistake that endangers investors, markets, and financial stability,"" said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a Washington-based advocacy group that regularly speaks out about crypto dangers. ""The SEC used to enforce the law without fear or favor but is now favoring the crypto industry and fearing billionaire crypto kingpins who are publicly belittling the agency."" The vote In the coming days, lawyers across the industry will watch the SEC's Coinbase vote, and then the judge's response in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. If the SEC formally backs off the accusations Coinbase improperly listed unregistered securities, it'll have to do the same in any similar cases. ""I'm hopeful that our getting this case dismissed will offer up a template for other cases to be resolved as well,"" Grewal said. ""And if that were the case, we'd be delighted, because we felt that Gary Gensler's entire campaign against crypto was a distortion — frankly, an abuse — of legal process."" As the agency continues to resolve past actions, it's signaled that the future intention is to focus on fraud over compliance disagreements. And Uyeda said as recently as Thursday that the SEC's new task force will be guiding its enforcement. ""One focus of this task force will be to ensure that we deploy enforcement resources judiciously,"" he  said at an event in Washington . Grewal acknowledged the next priority quickly becomes U.S. legislation that can establish clear regulations at the federal level.

One in 10  members of this Congress were boosted by Fairshake ads in their campaigns last year. ""We've seen Congress announce its commitment to legislation as early as the first 100 days,"" Grewal noted. ""So we're very eager, with this cloud now lifted, to focus our full attention on getting legislation passed on market structure and stablecoins. That is, frankly, long overdue.""

Renaming the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit is significant because it shows the agency is moving away from its crypto focus that often led to  accusations of regulation by enforcement  and legal battles with major industry participants. “In the near to medium term, clearer regulations will likely boost institutional participation, leading to improvements in market infrastructure,” BackPack founder and CEO Armani Ferrante told CoinDesk.

With tensions between the U.S. and its European allies growing, investors are hoping Germany's election on Sunday will lead to a stable coalition government that will push out economic reforms to stimulate growth and boost defense spending. Germany is Europe’s largest economy and a positive result could lead to a more risk-on approach. Open interest has already moved up ahead of the election. Still, the crypto market   lacks positive catalysts  in the near term, JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a report. In fact, the market is nearing backwardation — where spot prices rise above futures prices — in a “negative development” that’s “indicative of demand weakness” by institutional investors using regulated CME futures contracts to gain exposure to the market.

Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter said the craze is  ""unquestionably over,""  a view that might be cemented by a report revealing that West is  planning to introduce  YZY token — and will own 70% of the supply. The rest of the crypto market remains relatively unperturbed by the potential demise of the sector: ETH and LTC are up by 3% this week whilst TRX has risen by 7.7% as liquidity appears to be rotating from speculative tokens back to more utilitarian projects. NEAR leads the pack on Friday, surging by 11% after  announcing  the ""first truly autonomous"" AI agents. The agents will be able to autonomously own, trade and manage assets on-chain. Derivatives Positioning BTC open interest on centralized exchanges rose nearly 5% to $37.3 billion in the past 24 hours. This, coupled with the reversal in funding from positive to negative, suggests a potential short squeeze scenario. Short liquidations have dominated the futures markets over that period, nearing a total of $110 million compared with $6.11 million in longs. Among the assets with over $100 million in open interest, Maker DAO, Virtuals Protcol and Artificial Super Intelligence saw the highest one-day increase, rising by 39.2%, 35.5% and 28.00%, respectively. Among the options instruments, the call option on BTC with a strike price of $99,000 and expiring Feb. 22 has traded with the most volume on Deribit. The next most popular options instrument is the call on BTC with a strike price of $108,000, expiring on Feb. 28.

The Johannesburg-based company paid 1.8 million rand ($98,200) for just over 1 BTC, and said it doesn't plan to buy alternative cryptocurrencies. Altvest said it sees ""bitcoin as the only digital asset that meets its stringent investment criteria for a long-term treasury allocation."" Corporates are increasingly adding bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset. Michael Saylor's Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) pioneered the a move, starting to buy BTC in 2020. It now holds 478,740 bitcoin, worth more than $47 billion at current prices. The South African investment firm said the initiative to acquire bitcoin was ""focused on preserving shareholder value, mitigating currency depreciation risks, and gaining exposure to a globally recognized store of value."" Since Tokyo-based Metaplanet started buying bitcoin in April last year, it has acquired 2,031 tokens worth nearly $200 million and its shares became the  best-performing Japanese equity  over the past 12 months, with a gain of 3,900%. Earlier this month, investment bank  KBW started coverage of Strategy  with an outperform rating and a $560 price target. The shares are currently $323.92.

If demand for bitcoin and ether futures is healthy, the futures cost more than the spot price, and the curve is said to be in  contango , the bank noted. When demand slows and price expectations soften, the futures curve moves towards backwardation, the bank added.  This weakness in demand could be due to a number of reasons.  Positive crypto initiatives by Trump's new administration are more likely to kick in during the second half of the year, the bank said, and this means institutional investors are likely taking profits due to a lack of short-term catalysts.

Story continues Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Protocol Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . The token, YZY, is designed to help Ye side-step platforms like Shopify that have cut ties with him in response to his hateful rhetoric. Crypto, with its censorship-resistant ethos, offers Ye an alternative avenue for cashing in on his celebrity status: Seventy percent of the YZY token, named after Ye's Yeezy clothing brand, will be reserved for Ye personally, with just 10% allocated for liquidity provisioning and 20% for investors. Ye's foray into crypto comes on the heels of years of public controversy that have strained his business empire. In 2022, Ye was dropped by  Adidas ,  Balenciaga  and  his talent agency  after making a series of antisemitic comments, including praising Adolf Hitler in a live interview and tweeting inflammatory rhetoric about Jewish people and other groups. The fallout continued this year when Ye, after again  calling himself a Nazi on X ,  listed a T-shirt bearing a swastika on the Yeezy website , leading e-commerce platform  Shopify to shut down his online store . (Ye claimed on X this week that he was no longer a Nazi, thanking Adam Sandler ""for the love."" He made a similar reversal in 2022, crediting Jonah Hill.) YZY is being packaged as the official currency of Yeezy and will be accepted as payment on his website. CoinDesk learned about the token through an email from Hussein Lalani, a person with a yeezy.com email address who identified himself as Yeezy's chief financial officer. After sending a document describing the token unsolicited, Lalani requested that CoinDesk hold off on publication and agree to an ""embargo."" CoinDesk did not agree to the embargo, and three sources close to the project authenticated the document. Lalani did not respond to further requests for comment. The YZY token was initially set to go for sale on Yeezy's website on Thursday at 6:00 p.m., but the launch was delayed to Friday, according to a team member who asked not to be identified for fear of associating publicly with the project. Following TRUMP There have been murmurings of a potential Ye token since earlier this month, after the  rapper teased  that he had tried to contact Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Ye later posted that he was “ not doing a coin ” despite someone offering him $2 million to do so. He added: “ Coins prey on the fans with hype .” Sources close to the YZY team told CoinDesk that Ye aimed to emulate Donald Trump’s  TRUMP meme coin , which the president launched two days before his second inauguration. Trump raised eyebrows for his similarly massive insider-ownership distribution: 80% of TRUMP is currently held by CIC Digital, a company with ties to the president. Ye, too, wanted an 80% ownership stake but was negotiated down to 70%, an additional source close to the project who asked not to be identified told CoinDesk. Should Ye's token achieve even a fraction of TRUMP's success, his stake could still be worth many millions of dollars. 'The Milei thing' YZY enters an already saturated market of celebrity-driven crypto projects, many of which have been accused of exploiting fan loyalty without offering tangible utility. In many cases, these tokens see a short-lived price surge driven by hype before crashing, leaving retail investors holding the bag. Centralized ownership allocation only adds to the risk of sudden price drops. According to the unsolicited YZY press release, Ye’s 70% YZY stake is structured through a multi-phase vesting schedule — some coins are locked for up to 12 months, meaning they cannot be sold until then — though critics argue that such insider-heavy allocations still favor founders over retail investors. Just this week, Argentina became enmeshed in a political crisis after a meme coin endorsed by President Javier Milei, LIBRA, turned out to be a ""pump-and-dump"" scheme,  triggering public outrage and calls for impeachment. The source close to YZY told CoinDesk that the token's delay comes as its team ponders whether it's still ""too close to the Milei thing.""",8:20,8:46,en,20250221,"Rapper Kanye West, Self-Proclaimed 'Nazi' Who Said 'Coins Prey on Fans,' Plans Memecoin Launch",8:20,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/02/21/kanye-west-self-proclaimed-nazi-who-said-coins-prey-on-fans-plans-yzy-token,"Rapper Kanye West, Self-Proclaimed 'Nazi' Who Said 'Coins Prey on Fans,' Plans Memecoin Launch",CoinDesk,,article_page,sam-kessler,metered
20250220,markets,The latest MinerMag report shows a slowdown in Bitcoin hashrate growth amid shifting market conditions.,20:27,News,20250220,f384cafa-f77a-41af-8b78-c44cf56f79de,20250221,"After months of rapid expansion, Bitcoin’s hashrate growth slowed down in January, according to the latest report from TheMinerMag.  The network’s difficulty saw its first decline since September, indicating that even though publicly listed companies have kept increasing their hash power, their growth isn't enough to compensate for the capitulation of other, probably smaller operators. Story continues Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . The total revenue made from bitcoin (BTC) mining remained stable at $1.4 billion for the month. Publicly traded mining companies, which collectively hold 99,000 bitcoin (worth roughly $9.7 billion), accounted for about 30% of the hashrate market share in January. Competition between the biggest publicly traded companies has also increased. The leading mining firm, Marathon Digital (MARA), retained its top spot with a realized hashrate of 41.65 EH/s, followed by CleanSpark at 34.77 EH/s. Riot Platforms, which has been expanding aggressively, is closing in with 31.27 EH/s. “Notably, the competition within the 30 EH/s group is heating up like never before, while the gap between the 30 EH/s tier and the 10 EH/s group — comprising Core Scientific, Cipher Mining, and Bitfarms — continues to widen,” the report said. The top miners taking more market share is hardly a surprise as the recent halving event has cut bitcoin mining rewards by half and squeezed the industry's profit margin, even with the BTC price near $100,000. In such an environment, it's tough for smaller players to compete with big operations which were already positioned to dominate the market. In fact, a lot of miners are already looking for other revenue sources, such as hosting machines for AI and HPC firms.  Read more:  Bitcoin Halving Is a 'Show Me the Money' Moment for Miners The report also said that mining hardware imports to the U.S. also slowed in January, a factor contributing to the stabilization of hashrate growth. However, some firms, including Blockchain Power Corp and AcroHash, have imported a significant amount of cooling infrastructure from Bitmain. Looking ahead, TheMinerMag predicts another difficulty adjustment decline in February as some smaller mining operators exit the market due to lower profitability.

Story continues Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . Demuth said the 2024 bull run wasn’t a repeat of the retail-fueled 2021 cycle. Instead, it was being driven by what he calls “sticky money” — institutional capital that’s less volatile and more committed. Vienna-based Bitpanda is one of Europe’s largest crypto exchanges with over 6 million users and offers stocks and previous metals, in addition to digital assets. The platform recently  secured regulatory approval  from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom. Speaking about the impact of U.S. policies under the Trump administration, Demuth argued that the government's aggressive embrace of crypto is forcing global markets to adapt. “The Trump administration is forcing everybody to do this, it’s not an option anymore, [...] it’s mandatory.” A clear sign of this shift is the booming interest in Bitcoin ETFs, which have ballooned to nearly $58 billion in assets under management in just one year of trading. Demuth believes these vehicles signal a maturing market, where major players are locking in capital for the long term, rather than chasing quick gains. While altcoins haven’t picked up the same speed of adoption as bitcoin, Demuth believes that will change once U.S. regulation evolves and alternative crypto ETFs gain approval. He also believes that U.S. banks will be the next wave of adopters. “[Crypto] has been made one of the pillars of U.S. economic and financial policy, so you have the biggest financial power in the world putting [crypto] on the spotlight which means all the banks now have to either look into it or even offer something,” he said. He predicts a surge in stablecoin issuances directly from U.S. banks and an uptick in tokenized assets, from government bonds to real estate. In Europe, Bitpanda continues to focus on navigating the continent’s complex regulatory landscape, holding multiple licenses and positioning itself as a key player in a fragmented market. Demuth said the potential for new customers in Europe is big enough for the company to stay focused on its expansion in that region. However, the company is expanding its B2B services, he said, licensing its crypto infrastructure to banks in the Middle East as well as Europe. Major financial institutions, including Germany’s Deutsche Bank and France’s largest banking group, are already tapping into Bitpanda’s backend systems.",16:44,16:44,en,20250220,Trump Crypto Push Leaves World No Choice but to Embrace Digital Assets: Bitpanda's Demuth,16:44,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/02/20/trump-crypto-push-leaves-world-no-choice-but-to-embrace-digital-assets-bitpanda-s-demuth,Trump Crypto Push Leaves World No Choice but to Embrace Digital Assets: Bitpanda's Demuth,CoinDesk,bitpanda,article_page,helene-braun,metered

""With new leadership at the agency leading to today’s final dismissal, we’re looking forward to productive conversations between industry and the SEC moving forward – and a brighter future for digital assets in the United States,” said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith, in a statement. The rewritten dealer rule was one of the agency's major efforts at crypto rulemaking under the tenure of former chairman Gary Gensler, and it was crafted with the agency's longtime stance in mind that existing laws were sufficient to handle the oversight of the digital assets space. The industry's position was that the rule made untenable demands on decentralized finance (DeFi) and also roped in crypto traders who didn't offer dealer services. “The court found that the commission’s rule would classify nearly any person who buys and sells securities as a 'dealer,' extending beyond its statutory authority,"" an SEC spokesman said on Thursday. ""We dismissed the appeal because continuing to pursue it had the risk of reducing liquidity in the Treasury markets, making them more volatile, and increasing debt for taxpayers.” Since being installed as the SEC's acting chairman, Mark Uyeda, has begun to aggressively  overhaul the agency's senior staff  and its legal approach to the crypto sector.

Then,  DJ Windle  from Windle Wealth answers questions you may have from the article in Ask and Expert. –  Sarah Morton 30 Days of Trump: What’s Changed for Crypto? A year ago,  skepticism  and stalled policy progress stunted crypto’s growth. Trump’s election win has shifted the  Overton window  (referring to the change in political policies that people are willing to accept) on crypto’s acceptance, but will that lead to sustainable growth and regulatory clarity? His January 23  Executive Order  (EO) addressing crypto prioritizes ""responsible growth,"" a shift from President Biden’s 2022 EO focused on ""responsible development."" Early actions —  rescinding SAB 121 , ending Operation  Chokepoint 2.0 , pardoning  Ross Ulbricht  and  appointing new leaders  — signal change. One month in, progress is clear, but obstacles remain. A divided Congress, slow legislation and market speculation — seen in memecoins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA — complicate the path forward. The key question: Are we just moving past FTX, or will crypto be recognized as critical to Web3 innovation? Three Key Trends to Watch 1. Acceleration of Product Innovation The chart above clearly illustrates the Trump administration’s early focus on leadership changes and rollbacks of enforcement-driven policies. With regulatory enforcement easing, U.S. crypto development no longer needs to wait — or move offshore. The SEC’s  Crypto 2.0  initiative, led by Commissioner Peirce, shifts from enforcement-first policies to a new Crypto Taskforce. Meanwhile, the  President’s Working Group  on Digital Asset Markets, chaired by crypto advocate David Sacks, signals a more supportive stance. These shifts create space for innovation, allowing blockchain to prove its value before regulations catch up. Key areas for progress include  stablecoin regulation,  clearer  digital asset custody  requirements, hybrid TradFi-crypto products (such as expected Solana and ETH ETFs) and global payments advancements through partnerships like those with  X Money  and Visa. Resolving complex policy priorities will take time, as reflected in  a16z’s 11 priorities  and the Crypto Bar ’s open letter , highlighting the breadth of influential voices. As adoption grows, the network effect of successful crypto products will push for consensus-driven regulation. But without meaningful legislative action, the industry risks a return to uncertainty when Washington’s leadership inevitably shifts again. 2. Speculation vs. Sustainable Growth Amid all this optimism, crypto still struggles to establish credibility and prove itself as a force for responsible innovation. The opportunity to revolutionize finance is here — but is market speculation part of the growth or is it hindering sustainable growth? Memecoins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA surged just before the inauguration, reflecting demand for high-risk, culturally driven assets, while also raising  regulatory concerns  about volatility and integrity. The  class action lawsuit against pump.fun  underscores skepticism of growth untethered to sustainable utility. To maintain credibility, crypto must distinguish real-world and potential wealth creation applications from speculative assets. Fraud and misrepresentation remain illegal, whether in memecoins, penny stocks or collectibles. As the market evolves, businesses and investors must prioritize due diligence to separate hype from lasting potential. 3. The Urgent Need for Regulatory Clarity Despite leadership changes, there remains an urgent need for clear, enforceable crypto regulation. Key unresolved issues include: Addressing fraud and consumer protections without stifling innovation and decentralized finance Defining digital asset regulatory authority among agencies Establishing fit-for-purpose AML frameworks for stablecoins and other innovations With crypto-friendly leaders now at the  SEC  and  CFTC , regulatory progress is likely, but legislative action will take time. While Congress is considering proposals like the  GENIUS Act,  the STABLE Act, and new rules for market structure, pragmatic change isn’t guaranteed this year. For now, the industry must keep shifting the Overton window toward recognizing crypto’s role in U.S. tech leadership, public policy and economic security. Until comprehensive laws emerge, regulatory leadership — seen with the  CFTC pilot program  and recent Federal Reserve  speech  — must guide a stable path for growth. The Path Forward This year is pivotal — not just because toxic policies are fading and leadership has shifted, but because momentum is driving Web3 and blockchain forward. The goal isn’t just ""responsible growth"" but sustainable growth anchored in regulatory clarity. If the industry balances innovation with strong protections against fraud and theft, crypto’s resilience and credibility will be strengthened. With tech-neutral regulations, the U.S. won’t just lead in crypto and AI policy — we’ll also be ready for whatever else is next, from quantum computing to future breakthroughs. Sustainable innovation matters because technological progress is inevitable. - Beth Haddock, managing partner and founder, Warburton Advisers Ask an Expert  Q: Who is Ross Ulbricht? A:  Ross Ulbricht created Silk Road, an early bitcoin-powered marketplace that demonstrated crypto’s potential for decentralized commerce — both legally and illegally. His life sentence became a rallying cry in the crypto community, with many arguing it was excessive and highlighting broader debates on financial privacy and government control. His recent pardon has reignited discussions on justice reform and crypto’s role in the future of digital trade. Q: What are the risks of memecoins? A:  Memecoins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA are highly speculative, with prices driven more by social media hype than real utility. While they can generate quick profits, they also carry extreme volatility and risks of manipulation. Many lack long-term viability, so investors should approach them with caution and avoid putting more in them than they can afford to lose. Q: How could state bitcoin investments impact adoption? A:  If states allocate reserves to bitcoin, it could legitimize crypto as a store of value, encouraging institutional investors and policymakers to take it more seriously. This could accelerate regulatory clarity, enhance calls for clearer tax guidelines and integrate bitcoin into broader financial infrastructure, helping solidify its role in the economy. - DJ Windle, founder and portfolio manager, Windle Wealth Keep Reading Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, has invested approximately  $437 million  into BlackRock's bitcoin ETF.

PI debuted at $1.70 at 09:00 UTC, rising to as high as $2.00. It was recently trading at $0.97. The initial surge sent the fully diluted value (FDV) to as high as $195 billion — almost double the value of the Solana blockchain's  SOL . STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.

See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . The FDV is based on the maximum supply of a token, 100 billion in this case. The self-reported circulating supply is 6.3 billion, putting its market cap at around $6.1 billion. Pi Network has drawn comparisons to viral projects from previous cycles including SafeMoon, which also attracted a retail audience with aggressive marketing and referral schemes.  In order for users to begin mining the Pi token on a mobile device, they must first receive an invitation from another user. They are then issued with an invite code they can share themselves. More tokens are rewarded for each referred user, creating an ecosystem that mirrors multilevel marketing (MLM) or pyramid schemes. The project has been around since 2019 with its testnet going live in 2020. The token release marks start of the Pi Network mainnet, which means that all accrued tokens can be transferred and traded. However, exchanges currently lack sufficient liquidity to handle the billions of tokens being traded. In fact, even the most-liquid exchange, OKX, has a 2% market depth of between $33,000 and $60,000. That means an order of, say, $100,000 would move the price significantly, creating a volatile trading environment. Market depth measures the amount of capital required to move an asset in either direction. Based on the token's market cap, a 2% move would equate to a $146 million shift in the project's value. Pi Network has attempted to remedy a disparity between buyers and sellers by offering holders a ""lock-up"" period, which can be up to three years. If holders opt to lock up their tokens, they will receive higher mining rewards. A similar approach was employed by Richard Heart's controversial HEX token, which lost more than 99% of its value between 2021 and 2024, rendering many of the locked tokens worthless.",12:37,13:17,en,20250220,Pi Network's PI Token Debuts at $195B Fully Diluted Value Despite Minimal Liquidity,12:37,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/02/20/pi-network-s-token-debuts-at-usd195b-fdv-despite-minimal-liquidity,Pi Network's PI Token Debuts at $195B Fully Diluted Value Despite Minimal Liquidity,CoinDesk,"blockchain-tokens,markets,cryptocurrency-launch,smartphones,mining",article_page,oliver-knight,metered

Clients of BitGo and Copper can now trade spot and derivatives on Deribit while assets are secured off-exchange in qualified custody with BitGo Trust, and automatically settled leveraging Copper ClearLoop and the Go Network, according to a press release.

In a post-FTX world traders are looking to reduce the risks associated with leaving assets on exchanges where possible. BitGo and Copper announced  a partnership two years ago  to trade on exchanges while assets are held within a regulated custody ring-fenced environment. A simple function of the combined BitGo and Copper ClearLoop networks is delivery versus payment (DvP), so any BitGo client can instantaneously settle with any other BitGo client in an atomic swap of the assets without ever needing to bring those assets on chain, said Brett Reeves, head of BitGo’s Go Network. “We can do this DvP settlement from cold storage, and there's no fees for it,” Reeves said in an interview with CoinDesk. “So we're really looking at eliminating that settlement risk, or  Herstatt risk , and moving it towards the traditional finance space.” Under the hood, assets are held with qualified or regulated custody at BitGo, and then at pre-defined intraday settlement periods, the assets that are owed to Deribit are removed from a BitGo account into the Copper ecosystem through to Deribit, Reeves explained. If these assets are owed to the client, it comes back the other way, he said. “The bulk of the client's assets remain within Bitgo custody, apart from a settlement time when they move to exchange,” Reeves said. “At settlement time, that's the P&L that they owe on the transactions, or the variation margin on their positions.” ""The synergies between our companies will unlock new opportunities for investors and will completely change the landscape of trading,"" said Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit in a statement.",12:00,12:00,en,20250220,Crypto Custody Firms BitGo and Copper Deliver Off-Exchange Settlement for Deribit,12:00,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/02/20/crypto-custody-firms-bitgo-and-copper-deliver-off-exchange-settlement-for-deribit,Crypto Custody Firms BitGo and Copper Deliver Off-Exchange Settlement for Deribit,CoinDesk,"deribit,copper,bitgo",article_page,ian-allison,metered

Still, the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped and the dollar weakened. Cryptocurrencies are higher, with the CoinDesk 20 Index up 1.4% and bitcoin 1.2% over 24 hours. The gains follow remarks by Czech National Bank Governor Ales Michl, who reiterated the  case for bitcoin as a reserve asset , and President Donald Trump saying he'd ended “Joe Biden’s war on Bitcoin and crypto.” Bitcoin traders are taking a wait-and-see approach as waning demand, a lack of blockchain activity and faltering liquidity inflows point to  potential pullback to $86,000 . It's currently over $97,000. Their stance is visible not only in declining volatility, but also a significant drop in open interest. Open interest on bitcoin futures contracts has  fallen below $60 billion  from nearly $70 billion in late January, Coinglass data shows. The decline comes amid what appears to be an  unraveling of the memecoin craze   as recent struggles, such as Argentina's Libra debacle, dampened enthusiasm. “Right now, the market is in a bit of a cooldown phase,” David Gogel, VP of strategy and operations at the dYdX Foundation, told CoinDesk. “Bitcoin’s been holding up, but after failing to break past $105k in January, we’ve seen capital inflows slow down and speculative assets like Solana and memecoins take a hit.” That hit is visible in the aggregate open interest for futures contracts for SOL, the Solana blockchain's native token. OI dropped from around $6 billion late last month to around $4.3 billion now, according to data from TheTie. Solana is one of the leading networks for memecoins. “The market should stay attuned to broader macro-drivers and geopolitical developments that could trigger moves,” Wintermute OTC trader Jake O told CoinDesk. These geopolitical developments include rising tensions between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to a  not-so-subtle public exchange. Declining leverage and a shift away from riskier plays suggest the market may be entering a new phase. What that actually entails remains to be seen. Stay alert!

The network claims to have 60 million users. There are fewer than 1 million active wallets. Based on a  self-reported circulating supply  figure of 6.3 billion, PI currently has a market cap of $7.8 billion. The premise behind Pi Network is a blockchain that allows users to mine tokens on their smartphones. It captured a considerable amount of attention from retail traders and has drawn comparison to viral tokens from previous cycles like SafeMoon.  Token holders face the risk of a lack of liquidity. The token's most liquid exchange is OKX, but 2% market depth — the amount of capital required to move the price by 2% in either direction — is between $33K and $60K. This means an order of say $100K would shift the market considerably to present volatile trading conditions. Derivatives Positioning BTC volatility on derivatives has reached a monthly low, declining from an annualized 36.09% to 28.43%. That contrasts with ETH, which has seen its annualized volatility rise from 49.43% to 74.72%, according to data published by Deribit. Roughly $1.5 billion worth of BTC and ETH options are set to expire tomorrow, with almost $5 billion expiring in a week's time. The total open interest across all trading pairs on retail centralized exchanges has risen by 2.10% on the day to $80.8 billion.

The RWAccelerator comes at a pivotal time for the tokenized asset space.  The World Economic Forum  estimates that by 2027, 10% of the world’s GDP — around $10 trillion — could be stored on blockchain networks, with RWAs playing a major role in this shift. ""Our mission is really to build that bridge between kind of the large, planetary scale businesses that people use and are familiar with every day, particularly people who are not in the crypto space, and create that on ramp for those folks,"" said Richard Widmann, global head of Web3 strategy at Google Cloud, at Consensus Hong Kong. Startups can apply for one of three tracks: infrastructure, tokenization or decentralized finance (DeFi). Successful applicants will gain access to Google Cloud’s resources, including cloud credits, technical support and workshops led by Google engineers. MANTRA’s own team will offer guidance on everything from smart contracts and tokenomics to legal compliance and market strategies, the press release said. ""This is a powerful opportunity for startups to harness cutting-edge technology and gain access to resources and mentorship,” said John Patrick Mullin, CEO of MANTRA, in a statement. “With support from Google Cloud, this RWAccelerator will allow startups to reach new heights and significantly contribute to the wider Web3 community."" Applications for the first RWAccelerator cohort are open through March 20, 2025, with the program kicking off in Dubai in April. A second intake is scheduled to open the same day the first round closes. The launch of the accelerator follows MANTRA’s recent approval for a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), positioning it to offer exchange, broker-dealer and investment services in the region.

SecondSwap uses a liquidity routing algorithm that optimizes trade execution and minimizes price slippage to ensure secure and scalable trading experiences for buyers and sellers. Story continues Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . “By introducing a decentralized order book-style exchange, we are bringing transparency to token secondary markets,” said Kanny Lee, founder of SecondSwap, in an email to CoinDesk. “Our platform provides visibility into buy and sell orders, leveraging price discovery mechanisms such as market depth and liquidity profiling. Through seamless wallet integration, we ensure proof of control for sellers and proof of funds for buyers, enhancing security and trust.” Secondary markets for locked tokens refer to platforms or mechanisms where tokens that are under some form of lock-up or vesting schedule can be traded before they are fully released or unlocked. These markets provide a way for holders of locked tokens to gain liquidity, meaning they can convert their holdings into cash or other assets before the tokens are fully unlocked — giving early liquidity to sellers and the chance of gaining assets at a discount for buyers. SecondSwap has introduced a bid campaign to facilitate price discovery and enhance liquidity in early weeks, allowing traders to set their own prices and support matching between buyers and sellers once the buy/sell flow feature is enabled. Traders link their wallets, accessing a list of locked tokens that they can express an interest in buying by setting their preferred price target. Participants will be notified when inventory is available at prevailing prices, ensuring early adopters can engage with new opportunities as they emerge. The platform plans to expand to the Solana network in the coming months, a feat Lee says could unlock over $500 million in volume. “Locked token liquidity represents billions of dollars of untapped value. The impact of unlocking this liquidity cannot be understated. On Solana alone, even activating just 10% of dormant liquidity, could inject over $500 million in actionable volume,” Lee said.  “It’s definitely one of the drivers for partnering with Solana at the outset. When coupled with the impact that SecondSwap’s vesting mechanism can offer memecoins - to reduce circulating supply - the Solana partnership will continue to flourish and benefit the wider market.”",1:00,1:00,en,20250220,DEX SecondSwap Launches Mainnet on Ethereum With Plans for Solana Expansion,1:00,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/02/20/dex-secondswap-launches-mainnet-on-ethereum-with-plans-for-solana-expansion,DEX SecondSwap Launches Mainnet on Ethereum With Plans for Solana Expansion,CoinDesk,ethereum,article_page,shaurya-malwa,metered

In a  post on X , Carter argued that memecoins—tokens with little to no utility beyond speculative trading—were initially attractive because they appeared to offer an even playing field for retail investors. However, with recent scandals such as LIBRA coin, the market has been overtaken by insiders, prelaunch deals, and bot-driven trading, leaving everyday traders at a disadvantage. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . “The entire premise of memecoins was that they were ‘fair launch’ opportunities where retail had just as good a shot as funds and VCs,” Carter wrote. “That was exposed as a lie—the casino wasn’t fair.” Carter pointed to the launch of Milei's LIBRA coin, which opened at a $1 billion market cap before briefly spiking to $4 billion, as an example of how insiders now dominate the market. Such unfair launches, he said, have turned memecoins into a casino where the house overwhelmingly wins. Read more:  Libra Token’s Co-Creator Claimed He Paid Argentinian President Milei’s Sister While Carter thinks that the recent trading frenzy that started since the U.S. President Donald Trump started his TRUMP memecoin is over, he did note that the industry isn't going to disappear. Rather, there will still likely be a few new token launches and some winners, but the ""meta is done."" As confidence in memecoins fades, Carter expects regulators to take action against insider trading in the sector. “Just because memecoins probably aren’t securities doesn’t mean there’s no liability associated with trading on inside information,” he said, predicting that blockchain transaction histories will lead to future law enforcement actions. 'What maturation looks like' Looking ahead, Carter believes the market will shift toward more sustainable and fair token launches.  High pre-launch valuations have become less attractive, and projects are adapting by offering lower initial valuations to attract buyers. Platforms like Echo, which enforce accreditation and KYC, are likely to gain popularity for prelaunch fundraising, helping projects distribute tokens more fairly. Meanwhile, Carter expects increased legitimacy in DeFi tokens. With the SEC crafting clearer rules for token issuance, he sees a future where tokens can openly generate and return capital to users.  “The trade of the next few years is simply assessing the fundamentals of these tokens and buying those that trade at reasonable valuations relative to their real or implied cashflows,” he said. While some traders may lament the end of the memecoin gold rush, Carter argues that the market is simply maturing. “The pain of disillusionment is real, but ridding ourselves of the cancerous memecoin sector—which was in hindsight tremendously unfair—is a good development overall,” he wrote.

Demand for bitcoin, which picked up in late 2024 amid optimism over easing regulatory headwinds on Trump's election win, is now retreating. CryptoQuant data shows that demand growth slumped to 70,000 BTC recently from the 279,000 BTC peak on December 4. Inflows to spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETF), a typical occurrence during bitcoin’s previous rallies, have disappeared, booking regular net outflows over the past two weeks after previously seeing as much as 18,000 BTC in daily purchases in November and December.  Daily changes in BTC ETF holdings (CryptoQuant)   Meanwhile, CryptoQuant’s Inter-exchange Flow Pulse, which tracks BTC movement between exchanges, also signals weakness with BTC transfers to Coinbase—a gauge of U.S. spot demand—declining below its 90-day moving average. Bitcoin Apparent Demand metric (CryptoQuant)   Stablecoin growth, a key fuel during crypto market rallies, also lost momentum. Although the total stablecoin market cap recently rose to a  new all-time high  crossing $200 billion, the pace of the expansion has slowed significantly. The 60-day average change in USDT’s market capitalization, the largest stablecoin, plunged by over 90% since mid-December, dropping to $1.5 billion from over $20 billion. With stablecoins often used to buy crypto assets on exchanges, the slowdown indicates a lack of fresh capital entering the market. Muted blockchain activity on the Bitcoin network flashes further warning signs, CryptoQuant analysts said. Bitcoin’s network activity has slumped to its lowest level in a year, per CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Network Activity Index. The metric is down 17% from its November 2024 peak and fell below its 365-day moving average for the first time since July 2021, when China banned BTC mining. Fewer transactions indicate declining investor engagement and waning speculative interest. BTC may bottom soon After hitting a new record of $109,000 in January fueled by optimism around Donald Trump becoming president, BTC has struggled to hold its ground and has been languishing in a narrow range above $90,000. Meanwhile, sentiment in the broader crypto market has been battered by highly controversial memecoin launches in the past weeks, with the likes of  TRUMP memecoin  and  LIBRA  burning speculative capital. The sentiment reset is almost complete as bitcoin entered the final stretch of its weekly cycle, well-followed trader Bob Loukas noted. BTC could find a bottom of the corrective phase in the near-future, but it could break below the $90,000 range-low in doing so, he added.

Story Protocol launches to let people register IP and get paid for it Ethereum developers release new initiative to simplify cross-chain transactions Ethereum L1 monad joins forces with Orderly Network for DeFi boost How a sitting president became crypto's most sought-after investor Network News STORY PROTOCOL GOES LIVE:  Story Protocol launched its intellectual property-focused blockchain and associated IP token last week. The blockchain is positioned as the ""world's intellectual property network,"" providing users with a way to register their IP and track how others use it. The aptly named ""$IP"" token, which Story announced  earlier this month , is used for transaction fees and offers users a vote in the platform's governance system. So far, the IP focused blockchain seems to have had legs — at least with investors. PIP Labs, the chain's primary developer, raised $80 million in a Series B venture funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), bringing the project's total funding to $140 million. PIP has sought to position Story at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence, a way for people to track and get paid for data used to train AI models. The Story mainnet launch accompanies the first unlock event for the just-announced IP token. ""Story is unlocking 25% of the initial 1 billion $IP, with 58.4% devoted to the ecosystem and community, foundation, and initial incentives,"" according to the project.  — Sam Kessler   Read more . ETHEREUM DEVELOPERS RELEASE NEW OPEN INTENTS FRAMEWORK : A group of top Ethereum developers and leaders released Wednesday a new framework that would simplify and standardize cross-chain token transfers. The initiative, called the Open Intents Framework (OIF), was kickstarted by contributors from the Ethereum Foundation and is supported by 25 projects including teams building layer-2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, ZKsync, and Scroll, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.The goal of the initiative is to bring “intents” to all corners of the Ethereum ecosystem, which is a technological feature that  lets a blockchain user accomplish a specific goal  by asking an intermediary to fulfill that goal (like a trade or transaction they want to make.) There are some standards out there that are already trying to make cross-chain transactions easier by using intents. ERC-7683, which was introduced by the team behind the decentralized exchange Uniswap and the Across protocol, is  one of those standards  circulating the Ethereum space lately, and is supposed to address fragmentation and allow more chains in the Ethereum ecosystem to interoperate. But the OIF team claims that they will build on that standard through their framework allowing intents to function at scale. “By offering shared infrastructure and execution coordination, OIF makes intent-based transactions permissionless, efficient, and accessible for all projects,” the press release said.  — Margaux Nijkerk   Read more .  MONAD AND ORDERLY JOIN FORCES : Monad, an  Ethereum Virtual Machine  (EVM)  layer-1 blockchain  about to launch its testnet, has joined forces with Orderly Network, a  decentralized exchange  (DEX) infrastructure supporting a range of other chains, as the platforms spread their nets wide in anticipation of a second  decentralized finance  (DeFi) summer.  The arrival of the Monad testnet  on Wednesday will provide traders with a fast EVM-compatible building site and the possibility of airdrops on the L1. Orderly’s band of 20 or so market makers includes Wintermute, Selini and Riverside, according to a press release. Firms in the decentralized trading industry, which includes major exchanges like Coinbase (COIN), are  hoping for surge of DeFi activity  in the coming months as the crypto-friendly administration of President Donald Trump gives crypto a regulatory tailwind. The first DeFi summer, in 2020, came hot on the heels of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts in response to the Covid outbreak. Orderly already offers users a shared order book across multiple blockchains, including Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Base, Mantle and Near.  — Ian Allison  Read more . TRUMP - CRYPTO’S MOST INFLUENTIAL INVESTOR? : Crypto isn't all that different from politics. According to Rushi Manche, the founder of blockchain company Movement, ""Crypto is an attention game.""It's fitting, then, that Donald Trump — the master of all things attention — is so at home selling memecoins. But it's not just Trump's inner circle that's managed to capitalize on his crypto ventures, which include the $TRUMP coin and World Liberty Financial. Once a  vocal crypto skeptic , the president has become the industry's largest ""key opinion leader"" — or KOL, in blockchain industry parlance: a trader whose portfolio is closely watched by other investors deciding what to buy and sell. Trump's foray into crypto has created a new go-to-market playbook for ambitious token peddlers like Manche — blockchain founders who realize pumping the price of a token can be as simple as elbowing into a sitting president's crypto portfolio. The president's primary vehicle for blockchain trades is World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized finance (DeFi) venture he announced with his sons over the summer. After accruing more than $400 million by selling a token, the company, which does not yet have a product, has built up a portfolio containing millions of dollars in the assets of other crypto projects.  On Wednesday , it announced it was launching an official ""strategic reserve"" of crypto investments. The trades have already raised  serious concerns  about conflicts of interest, insider dealing, and the very nature of how influence is leveraged in the digital asset space. Trump's political opponents are  calling for investigations  into his growing blockchain empire. But crypto founders like Manche see World Liberty's crypto investments as something different: a once-in-a-generation marketing opportunity. ""You need to have a product roadmap that makes sense,"" said Manche. ""But you also need to have a strategy for your token."" And what better way to boost the price of your cryptocurrency than by publicly tying it to the leader of the free world?  — Sam Kessler  Read more .

The Internal Revenue Service — the U.S. Treasury Department's tax arm — pushed through a key  digital assets broker rule  between Christmas and New Year's, just days before President Donald Trump's administration was set to arrive.

Recently approved rules can be erased under the Congressional Review Act, and Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican,  introduced a resolution  last week that would do just that. The unified industry letter on Wednesday — led by the Blockchain Association and joined by Coinbase, a16z, Paradigm, Kraken, Uniswap, Anchorage Digital and dozens of others — asks the rest of Congress to embrace Cruz's measure. ""The DeFi broker rule, finalized in the waning days of the Biden administration, represents regulatory overreach that fundamentally misunderstands the technology it attempts to regulate and ignores Congress’s intent,"" according to the letter, sent to the leadership in both chambers of Congress. Using Congress's power to reverse federal agency regulations offers ""a clear and definitive path to rolling back this damaging rule before it can take effect."" The businesses collectively argued that the rule unfairly targets U.S. firms with rules that foreign competitors wouldn't have to follow when servicing U.S. customers. ""This unique burden on American companies alone could cripple DeFi innovation in this country altogether,"" they said. The CRA can be a powerful but sometimes blunt tool that spiked in popularity during President Donald Trump's first term. Where it's blunt is in its secondary effect: Any regulatory topic reversed in this way can never be reintroduced in any similar fashion, potentially making it difficult to apply friendlier regulations in the same area. When Congress sought to use it to repeal the Securities and Exchange Commission's crypto accounting policy, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, the minority who opposed the effort argued that it would hamstring future SEC efforts to address digital assets accounting. While both chambers did approve that CRA effort,  then-President Joe Biden vetoed the attempt , leaving Trump's interim SEC chief, Mark Uyeda, to move recently to get the  same thing accomplished  internally. A CRA resolution needs majority approval in both Chambers of Congress before it can be sent to President Trump for a potential sign-off. After the 2024 elections, many more pro-crypto lawmakers are walking the halls on Capitol Hill, though congressional attention is a hot commodity, and other pressing matters such as the federal budget are looming. Beyond the letter, other crypto organizations are also weighing in. A spokesperson from the DeFi Education Fund said it's ""thrilled"" to see momentum building against the ""unworkable, unconstitutional"" rule that the group is committed to ensuring doesn't get implemented.

Investors with assets over $100 million are required by the SEC to report their holdings each quarter. Several hedge funds and pension funds, among others, have started buying the funds since January 2024, when the bitcoin ETFs were first launched. Since then, some of them have increased their holdings over the past year, like the State of Wisconsin’s investment board, which boosted its holdings to just over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of Dec. 31. Similarly, billionaire hedge fund investor Paul Tudor nearly doubled its stake in IBIT to 8,048,552 shares, up from 4,428,230. Meanwhile, Corvex Management, an asset management firm founded by investor Keith Meister in December 2010, disclosed holding more than a million shares in IBIT at the end of the fourth quarter. According to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst  Eric Balchunas , IBIT currently has 1,100 institutional holders that have reported their stake via 13F filings. He said most newly launched ETFs typically have under 10 holders. “No way to track but my guess is the record for first year prior to this was [probably] like 350 [institutional holders for new ETFs],” Balchunas wrote.",16:19,16:19,en,20250219,"TradFi Investors Piled $38.7B Into Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs, Three Times More Than Previous Quarter",16:19,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/02/19/tradfi-investors-piled-usd38-7b-into-bitcoin-etfs-three-times-more-than-previous-quarter,"TradFi Investors Piled $38.7B Into Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs, Three Times More Than Previous Quarter",CoinDesk,"bitcoin-etf,market-analysis",article_page,helene-braun,metered

While there are a number of platforms and service providers offering tokenization-as-a-service, there have typically been inherent limitations associated with bringing existing legacy assets on-chain in a dynamic manner. Tokenizing a portfolio of loans from a middle-market direct lender may create an opportunity to use the portfolio collateral as non-crypto collateral within DeFi applications like Moonwell, Aave or Morpho, for example. The ideal real-world asset lending workflow taken from Blue Water’s  Opportunities in Tokenization 2025 report  is displayed below. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.

Importantly, the concept will likely fail if the direct lender only marks its portfolio holdings quarterly, semi-annually or annually, as that timeline drastically lags the usual real-time execution expected within digital asset markets. To truly unlock the trillions of dollars of current, performing alternative assets in the universe there must be an operating system or systems that enable end-goal applications; these applications include decentralized exchanges, decentralized lending platforms and peer-to-peer collateral transfers from which to constantly draw financial asset data. But doing this for DeFi applications is not feasible by sifting through tens or hundreds of Excel spreadsheets and siloed files in an attempt to ingest asset-level data. Below are some additional factors for consideration in shifting towards blockchain environments: 1. Transparency and proof-of-metrics — “metric” being anything including reserves, holdings, state, authorization, etc. — are the lifeblood of crypto markets. Bringing legacy assets on-chain in a meaningful way will require above-average levels of transparency, at least for direct investors and participants. 2. Any operational speedbumps inhibiting a 24/7 operating schedule will reduce trust and increase execution risk in the eyes of crypto investors. That means manual employee updates, edits and working hours will decrease the attractiveness of real-world assets to the crypto markets. 3. As a combination of the first two points, seasoned crypto participants will likely require a holistic solution enabling real-time monitoring of the off-chain assets backing their tokens and near real-time execution speed, whether that be trading, subscriptions, redemptions or loan processing. For example, Inveniam's blockchain-based operating system displayed here enables private assets to bridge into crypto-native ecosystems that they previously could not. These points are not as threatening to newly-issued digitally-native assets like Tradable’s $1.7 billion in loans or Figure’s $10+ billion in HELOCs, since the full life cycle and associated data of these products began and still exists on-chain. However, for the trillions of dollars worth of existing assets that many in the field are targeting, porting operating and lifecycle data from an array of Excel sheets to an operating system that can ingest the data, credential it on a blockchain, and ping that data out in real-time will put things at the goal line. Platforms such as  the Inveniam  operating system displayed above and  Accountable , as well as blockchain layers like Chainlink and Pyth, provide some low-hanging fruit for asset managers and capital markets players to get token-ready by onboarding to blockchain rails.",16:16,16:16,en,20250219,The Key to Tokenization: Real-Time Data and Transparent Operations,16:16,https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/02/19/onboarding-the-buy-side-to-blockchain-rails,The Key to Tokenization: Real-Time Data and Transparent Operations,CoinDesk,"tokenization,defi,crypto-long-short,opinion",article_page,peter-gaffney,metered

Even with the removal of “ Operation Chokepoint 2.0 ” restrictions, institutions and individuals aren’t able to access the money markets with the level of efficiency that traditional Main Street, let alone Wall Street, is able to. This has created an opportunity for many crypto native-entities to take advantage of what they do have — good collateral — and to use that collateral to borrow U.S. dollars (USD). The result is an asset-backed loan that has the potential to yield more than it “should.” Story continues Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Long & Short Newsletter today .

With junk bond spreads less than 300 basis points (bps) above U.S. Treasuries, BTC-backed loans may offer more yield than junk bonds with less risk than investment-grade bonds. Using current market conditions and a standard credit default modeling technique, BlockFills estimates a fair value of 150-200 bps over USTs for BTC backed loans, yet they currently trade at 400-600 bps over USTs. Overcollateralized BTC-backed loans may present a great opportunity for traditional finance institutions participating in crypto at scale, in a fashion that is reminiscent of prior innovations like mortgages and junk bonds. These transactions can be structured in a  Tri-Party arrangement , which is when two parties engage a third party as a trusted custodian for funds held in escrow. This removes the need to custody crypto, handle margin calls and deal with selling the collateral under default conditions. Crypto market participants and businesses simply do not have full access to the USD banking system. These BTC-backed loans are a possible solution to fill the gap. The collateral is good, tradable and liquid in both on- and offshore markets. This compares favorably with default conditions in corporate loans where bankruptcy proceedings can last for years (or decades). A portfolio of such loans does not represent diversification since all these loans would be backed by cryptocurrency. However, that does mean that a portfolio may be hedged using the options* market, which has also become liquid in both listed and OTC markets for BTC. The BTC-backed loan market is an opportunity that bridges crypto and traditional finance. It’s not meant to provide the sort of “degen” returns that may be available in outright positions but instead speaks to the sorts of investment parameters that come with vocabulary recognizable to the Patagonia vest-wearing crowd. Terms like “excess risk-adjusted return” and “harvesting premiums” are reminiscent of the 80s and 90s.

Story continues Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Protocol Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . The initiative, called the Open Intents Framework (OIF), was kickstarted by contributors from the Ethereum Foundation and is supported by 25 projects including teams building layer-2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, ZKsync, and Scroll, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. The goal of the initiative is to bring “intents” to all corners of the Ethereum ecosystem, which is a technological feature that  lets a blockchain user accomplish a specific goal  by asking an intermediary to fulfill that goal (like a trade or transaction they want to make.) There are some standards out there that are already trying to make cross-chain transactions easier by using intents. ERC-7683, which was introduced by the team behind the decentralized exchange Uniswap and the Across protocol, is  one of those standards  circulating the Ethereum space lately, and is supposed to address fragmentation and allow more chains in the Ethereum ecosystem to interoperate. But the OIF team claims that they will build on that standard through their framework allowing intents to function at scale. “By offering shared infrastructure and execution coordination, OIF makes intent-based transactions permissionless, efficient, and accessible for all projects,” the press release said. “As Ethereum's ecosystem becomes increasingly multichain, intents help streamline fragmented user experiences by enabling seamless, near-instant cross-chain transactions through specialized solvers. However, integrating intents remains complex and resource-intensive, making an open intents framework essential to standardize infrastructure, reduce barriers to adoption, and foster broader collaboration across the ecosystem,” the team shared with CoinDesk.

The final  order of forfeiture  issued on Tuesday by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York formally severed Bankman-Fried's ownership stake in a property list dozens of pages long.

The Swedish company is launching a satellite with Spire Global, which operates a low-orbit satellite constellation. The satellite will be carried by SpaceX’s Transporter-13 mission in late February from Vandenburg Space Force Base in California. Discussing the launch during Consensus Hong Kong, Robin Wingardh, Wingbits' CEO and co-founder, said the satellite complements the startup’s 2,200-strong on-the-ground node network managed by flight enthusiasts around the world.

The satellite, scheduled for launch on SpaceX’s Transporter-13 mission in February, will act as a validator of Wingbits’ cryptographically-secured ADS-B ground data, with the goal of creating a community-powered, tamper-proof tracking network.    The decentralized physical infrastructure network, or DePIN, project rewards data providers with Solana testnet tokens. The existing flight-tracking industry also relies on flight enthusiasts to supply data on airplane movements. Companies such as FlightAware and Flightradar24 sell data to aviation analytics companies, airlines, insurers and others, but don’t reward the enthusiasts for their work, Wingardh said.  Wingbits already has data contributors from over 90 countries tracking some 120,000 unique flights daily. It plans to create a worldwide network through the reward system, which allows tokens to be exchanged for air miles, airport lounge access and other services. Wingardh said the satellite, when launched, will allow the company to verify data from the ground, providing protection against “spoofing” by cross checking flight data from the DePIN against data from the satellite, Wingbits hopes to ensure its information is more accurate than its competitors’.  The company  recently closed a second seed round for $5.6 million  from Borderless Capital, Bullish Capital (part of the Bullish Group that also owns CoinDesk) and others.

The launch of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund marks the first Luxembourg-domiciled fund investing in U.S. government securities that's fully tokenized, the asset manager claimed in a press release. This means shares in the fund are recorded and transferred on the blockchain rather than through traditional processes, using Franklin Templeton's proprietary blockchain-based transfer agency platform for handling transactions to offer enhanced efficiency, transparency and security. The fund is available on the Stellar network (XLM) for institutional investors in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, following  regulatory approval  in October by Luxembourg regulators. The U.S.-registered version of the fund has attracted over $580 million of assets since its 2021 debut and is limited to U.S.-based investors only, per  rwa.xyz data . Tokenized U.S. Treasuries have been at the forefront of red-hot real-world asset tokenization efforts, growing into a $4 billion asset class this year. Franklin Templeton was the first among traditional financial institutions to release such a product, and its the third largest tokenized treasury fund by assets under management behind Hashnote's USYC and BUIDL, issued by BlackRock and Securitize.

See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . ""As Western restrictions tighten, sanctioned nations are turning to cryptocurrencies and alternative financial systems to sustain trade and access capital,"" according to the report, which cited Russian and Iranian financial transactions with trade partners such as China and India,  using payment mechanisms that don't rely on U.S. dollars . ""While cryptocurrency use in sanctioned jurisdictions may be associated with illicit state-controlled finance, it also represents an important financial lifeline for ordinary citizens facing economic hardship under restrictive regimes,"" the report said. The U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, is the government arm that sets sanctions, and last year it issued 13 that included crypto addresses. That was down from the previous year, but still high. Now that President Donald Trump has taken over the executive branch and  installed Scott Bessent  atop the Treasury, the pro-crypto administration may take a different approach to digital assets. Crypto-mixing platform Tornado Cash had been famously  targeted by U.S. authorities  in 2023, but the popular service was still able to handle hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto transactions a month in 2024, the report said, though it hasn't returned to its pre-sanction level. Such services are criticized for their use in the laundering of stolen funds or in evading sanctions, and they're difficult to shutter because they operate via smart contracts on a decentralized blockchain. Users pushing stolen funds accounted for an increase in Tornado Cash's usage in 2024, amounting to more than 24% of its total inflows, according to Chainalysis. Tornado Cash has come to represent the industry's legal fight with the U.S. government over user anonymity and whether developers should be liable for what they create, and a U.S. federal appeals court  rejected the original sanctions  in November. Chainalysis devoted close attention to Iran in its latest report. ""Iran’s government maintains extensive control over the country’s financial system, including cryptocurrency infrastructure,"" the document noted. ""For many Iranians, cryptocurrency represents an alternative financial system, and the increasing use of Iranian crypto exchanges suggests that more individuals and institutions are resorting to crypto to safeguard wealth and circumvent financial restrictions.""

The drop signals bitcoin's maturation as an asset, according to Tracy Jin, COO of cryptocurrency trading platform MEXC. ""Rather than reacting sharply to short-term market shocks, BTC is showing signs of stabilization, increasingly resembling the dynamics of commodity markets and traditional safe-haven assets,” Jin said. While FTX creditor payouts have  started rolling out,  the Libra token debacle just keeps intensifying. The co-creator of the token, Hayden Davis,  bragged about buying access  to Argentine President Javier Milei’s inner circle ahead of the memecoin’s launch, according to messages reviewed by CoinDesk. Meanwhile, Strategy, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, is set to r aise an additional $2 billion  by selling zero-coupon convertible notes. The funds raised will mostly be used to accumulate more BTC. As Brevan Howard Digital’s CEO and CIO — that's just one person — stressed at Consensus Hong Kong, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has evolved since the collapse of FTX, but 24/7 risk management is still a necessity. On the macro front, traders are focusing on minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January interest rate meeting. Indications of the potential impact of increased tariffs are a particular point of focus, given President Donald Trump’s comments on tariffs “in the neighborhood of 25% for automobiles, semiconductors, and pharmaceutical products.” Recent  U.S.-Russia talks  in Riyadh have led to the appointing of teams to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine and commitments to “normalize the operation” of their diplomatic missions. Still, excluding representatives from Ukraine and Europe remains a point of contention. Stay alert!

The market cap of the sector is down 4.4% in 24 hours to $72.9 billion as traders begin to pull liquidity and  question the legitimacy  of a market many view as an endless cycle of ""pump and dumps."" More than $35 billion worth of value has exited decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols since mid-December.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . Folkman remarked that, ""the goal of the project is being able to create progress to actually merge traditional financial institutions with decentralized finance,” in a panel at CoinDesk's Consensus Hong Kong conference. For several weeks, the Trump-endorsed WLFI faced lackluster sales, failing to reach its $30 million fundraising target. The token was restricted from trading and only available to non-U.S. investors and accredited U.S. investors. The project's fortunes changed, however, when Sun stepped in. “This guy,” Folkman said with a gesture towards Sun, “saw that regardless of the outcome, this project is a monumental move forward for the entire crypto community.” When Trump announced World Liberty Financial alongside his sons in October, they said it would be a lending platform based on Aave — a popular Ethereum-based decentralized finance protocol. The platform has yet to launch, but according to Folkman, World Liberty is now developing ""a whole range of products and applications"" — not just a single tool. Today, World Liberty Financial is known for WLFI, the governance token that it put up for sale mere days after the project was unveiled. ""When we were launching this project, it was a very heated time,"" Folkman told the panel. ""There was a lot of scrutiny on our project due to who was involved."" After Sun's 10-figure endorsement, “everything kind of snowballed from there,” said Folkman. World Liberty not only oversold its fundraising target, but it eventually set a new one. Should it meet its new goal — which it seems poised to do soon — Folkman noted that WLFI will become the fourth-largest initial coin offering (ICO) of all time. Folkman claims WLFI's success came despite ""no VC backing and no special treatment to anybody who purchased the token."" Sun, however, was elevated to an official World Liberty investor after his WLFI purchase. World Liberty also bought $10 million worth of TRX tokens — the native token of Sun's TRON blockchain — and WBTC, a Sun-linked bitcoin derivative. Earlier in Feb., Blockworks reported that World Liberty has been shopping a deal to crypto teams: If a company purchases WLFI tokens and pays an additional fee, World Liberty will add that company's tokens to its portfolio — a  powerful marketing  instrument for up-and-coming crypto tokens. “I’ve seen that going around,"" Folkman said of the report.

",8:38,News,20250219,7288f869-2981-4c02-ac6e-6e6b1aee7df3,20250219,"The latest frenzy that started with U.S. President Donald Trump's TRUMP memecoin launch and saw traders making and losing millions within minutes, might have finally come crashing down with the LIBRA token fiasco. LIBRA, a Solana-based project that President of Argentina Javier Milei tweeted about on Feb. 14, saw its market cap rise as high as $4.5 billion and then fall more than 80% within a couple of hours as insiders cashed out, leaving many bag holders with massive losses. Story continues Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Long & Short Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . The story became an international and political incident over the weekend when in the last couple of days, Milei deleted his original tweet, denied his endorsement and accused the political opposition of mischief. This eventually led to talks of his impeachment and created uncertainty in the Argentinian stock market. Then came an explosive twist to the story. On Tuesday, CoinDesk broke the news that a key player behind the LIBRA token had  bragged about buying access  to Argentine President Javier Milei's inner circle months before the memecoin's scandalous launch and crash. Although these kinds of kerfuffle for a memecoin are not unusual, how this happened and what followed after the apparent ""rug pull"" highlighted the risk of unchecked crypto trading and the potential for a reputational hit for the memecoin sector as a whole. ""The LIBRA episode represents what is a potential point of oversaturation for the memecoin space,"" said Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial. ""At this point, the novelty of new projects, after TRUMP and MELANIA, and now LIBRA, has largely worn off."" ""Additionally, the reputational consequences for these assets may be significant. Having said that, it appears that this episode is likely to continue playing out as new details emerge. At this point, memecoins are synonymous with ‘pump and dump’ schemes,"" FRNT contended. This incident, along with other memecoin-related  events  that led to many retail traders losing money, may nudge the community to make more of an effort to police itself. ""The entire $LIBRA memecoin fiasco over the weekend should serve as a reminder that all of us in the DeFi community have a responsibility to make this space safer for users,"" said Chris Chung, founder of Solana-based swap platform Titan. How the 'fiasco' happened The whole Milei and LIBRA episode played out within the span of a few days, starting on Feb. 14. As explained by Galaxy Research's Alex Thorn, the token launched on that fateful day on a Solana-based DeX Meteora, with Milei's initial post (now deleted) on  social media platform X  saying that the aim of the token was to help the growth of the Argentinian economy — a big endorsement for a memecoin.  Once the token price reached its peak of $4.4 billion within hours, the insiders started dumping their holdings immediately, making nearly $100 million, according to onchain analysts. The next day, Milei deleted his original post, sending a shockwave within the memecoin community, that saw many similar tokens, such as TRUMP, MILANIA, and others, sell out fast. Meanwhile, Solana, the blockchain the token was built on, also saw its native token, SOL, fall. In his new post, Milei claimed he  wasn't aware  of the details of the project and accused the political opposition of mischief, making the situation a game of politics. By that time, the token had erased around $4.5 billion of retail capital in seven hours. Currently, the market cap sits around just above half a million, according to  CoinMarketCap data . The same day, names of a few key opinion leaders (KOL) came up, including Barstool’s Dave Portnoy, Threadguy, Hayden Davis and Faze Banks, who were involved in one way or another with the project. Portnoy said he was an early investor and was refunded his money, further spreading the controversy that insiders benefitted from the LIBRA fiasco. Davis, meanwhile, revealed that he was behind both the LIBRA and MELANIA memecoins and said the Argentinian token incident was ""not a  rug pull ,"" rather ""It's just a plan gone miserably wrong."" The next day, the Argentinian opposition threatened Milei with  impeachment  over the incident. On Feb. 17, Ben Chow, co-founder of DeX Meteora, where LIBRA had launched,  resigned  over the controversy. Chow was also a co-founder of Solana-based trading aggregator Jupiter. The same day Argentina's stock market  collapsed  almost 6% on a report of a probe on Milei. Timeline of LIBRA fallout (Galaxy Research)   Read more:  LIBRA Apparent Rug Pull Is Latest 'Sordid Episode' Emerging From Solana's Memecoin Complex: Galaxy On Feb. 18, CoinDesk  broke the news  that Davis claimed in text messages that he could ""control"" Milei because of payments he had been making to Karina Milei, a powerful figure in Milei's government, and the president's sister. 'Setback for crypto' What will happen to Milei and all the involved parties is still unknown. However, if FTX's spectacular blowout is anything to go by, there might still be a lot more to untangle in this story.  What it does highlight is that the memecoin drama that has become a game of split-second profit and losses, in this cycle, might be at a crossroads. As institutional investors are betting big on bitcoin and ether with the launch of exchange-traded funds, making those assets more TradFi friendly and stable, the memecoin sector has stuck out as the ugly duckling of the crypto space, and this incident may sour retail participation. ""Overall, this entire story is a real setback for the crypto space,"" Chung said.

Sharma stressed the need for 24/7 risk management, including market, counterparty, and credit risks. Counterparty risk refers to the possibility of one party involved in a transaction failing to meet its obligation, resulting in a loss to the other party. This type of risk is higher in crypto than in traditional finance, given the absence of intermediaries such as banks or clearing houses that ensure trust and settlements, and it is a cause of concern for both directional and non-directional arbitration players. ""When we do arbitrage, the counterparty risk is the most important one,"" Fabio Frontini, founder of Abraxas Capital Management, said, adding that credit risk is also very important. Frontini stressed the importance of simulating stress testing scenarios, referring to the perpetual futures market where users can lose the margin when stopped out on a trade, which is not the case in traditional markets. ""It [stress testing] can be very rewarding, when done properly,"" Frontini added. Mike Kuehnel, CEO of the market-making firm Flow Traders, highlighted the need to make innovation transparent to win over investor confidence and ensure ""availability of data and moving liquidity without fragmentation around it."" ""Getting the best price and giving you the possibility to transact whenever you want to is a key ingredient,"" Kuehnel added. Liquidity, or the ability of the market to absorb large orders at stable prices, emerged as a significant concern following the collapse of FTX and its sister concern, Alameda. While the order book depth has surely improved for major coins, fragmentation or distribution of liquidity across multiple DeFi platforms, blockchains and networks, remains a concern.

The statement continued as follows: ""Recent media reports claiming I paid President Javier Milei or his sister, Karina Milei, to launch the Libra memecoin are completely false. I never made any payments to them, nor did they request any. Their only concern was ensuring proceeds from Libra would benefit Argentina’s people and economy."" The statement added: ""This is nothing more than a politically motivated attack on President Milei."" Karina Milei, a key figure in her brother's government, currently holds the post of General Secretary of the Presidency of the Argentine Nation. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.  It was unclear if any money was exchanged between Davis and Milei's inner circle in advance of Libra's launch. Davis' December claims add a new dimension to an anti-corruption probe that Argentina's presidential office has opened into Javier Milei, who, on Feb. 15, brought attention to the doomed Libra crypto as a novel way to fund small businesses in that country. But the biggest winner from the Solana-based memecoin's launch was Davis and Kelsier Ventures. Wallets controlled by the entities netted over $100 million in Libra's early hours, when it soared to $5 and then crashed over 95%, wiping out millions of dollars of speculative investments. Opposition leaders in Argentina have threatened to call for an  impeachment trial  over the incident, which the local press has coined, ""criptogate."" The scandal is weighing on Argentina's stock market and pushed Milei into ""damage control,"" said one observer of the country's crypto space. In the December text messages, Davis claimed he could get Milei to promote ventures on social media. Milei's tweet about Libra two months later fueled its rise.

The Solana ecosystem, which is benefitted generously as a hub for memecoin trading and launching tokens, is  grappling with the fallout  from LIBRA, the latest  scandalous pump-and-dump token launch  that put several key figures in the Solana space and even Argentina's President Javier Milei in the hot seat. LIBRA was released on Friday and zoomed to $4 billion market capitalization after Milei's X post saying the project would support small and mid-sized businesses in the country. The token then lost nearly all its market value as insiders cashed in $100 million and Milei backpedalled his support. Milei now faces fraud charges and a  possible impeachment , and Solana-based DEX Meteora co-founder Ben Chow resigned after being implicated in the token launch.

The report pointed out that  sentiment towards memecoins began to erode  since the TRUMP token If sentiment weren't at rock bottom, the upcoming SOL unlock event increasing the token's circulating supply injects an additional dose of uncertainty in the markets. Estimates vary on the exact amount of tokens to be released into circulation, but one hedge fund analyst forecasted that some 15.725 million SOL, worth roughly $2.5 billion at current prices, will be unlocked over the next three months, with much of the tokens coming from the FTX estate holdings.

Those institutions can choose to settle transactions using stablecoins, reflecting a broader trend in crypto adoption. Story continues Don't miss another story.

Last week, the payments giant announced a partnership with crypto compliance firm Notabene, which will integrate Mastercard’s Crypto Credential into its SafeTransact platform to make digital asset transactions more secure and user-friendly. The Crypto Credential system continues to be a focus of Mastercard’s efforts to make crypto more mainstream. It allows users to send funds using familiar identifiers like email addresses rather than complex wallet addresses while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The system also helps prevent misdirected transactions by verifying whether a recipient’s wallet can receive a specific asset. “What is stopping [crypto] from going mainstream is really that consumers need to be able to find each other using what they already know,” Dhamodharan said. Mastercard’s goal, according to Dhamodharan, is to be a connector between traditional finance and blockchain networks, ensuring regulatory compliance while enabling new business models. The company plans to announce additional partnerships and use cases in 2025, reinforcing its commitment to integrating crypto into global payments. “As an industry as a whole, we need to be very open to making [crypto] available as broadly as possible,” he said. Previously, the payments giant partnered with several crypto-native companies, including Binance. The two parted ways in August 2023 after Binance faced a series of legal issues in the U.S. Mastercard re-allowed users to purchase crypto on the exchange again a year later. “Binance is a great partner of ours,” Dhamodharan said. “We continue to partner with them in a number of new ways where we can help them with on-ramp and off-ramp. Those are the continuing conversations.” Taking crypto to the 'next level' Dhamodharan is also optimistic about the future of tokenization, which he said will require new business models to feed the growing demand for tokenization real-world assets by companies like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. “​​If there is more clarity over time in terms of how deposits can be represented in some form on the public chain, from a regulatory standpoint, I think this can even go to the next level in terms of how it can scale,” he said. In 2025, Mastercard’s focus lies on the on-ramp/off-ramp between crypto and the banking world, while making that process as smooth and safe as possible as well as expanding features and functions of its Crypto Credential product. The third focus is stablecoins, the company said. “We think the future is going to be a world of both deposits because that's where the money is, and that's where people and businesses hold money and stablecoins, which can move on-chain easily and get settled easily.” Read more:  Mastercard and JPMorgan Link Up to Bring Cross-Border Payments on the Blockchain",15:59,15:59,en,20250218,"Mastercard Says It Has Moved Beyond Experimentation in Crypto, Focused on 'Real Solutions'",15:59,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/02/18/mastercard-says-it-has-moved-beyond-experimentation-in-crypto-focused-on-real-solutions,"Mastercard Says It Has Moved Beyond Experimentation in Crypto, Focused on 'Real Solutions'",CoinDesk,"mastercard,exclusive",article_page,helene-braun,metered

A thief (or thieves) is said to have made off with at least $5.6 million by posing as a person looking to sell his high-dollar FTX liquidation claims, which checked out as valid even though they were not ultimately connected to the person allegedly scamming buyers. The potential thief may have used face-swapping video technology in calls and also is said to have faked other credentials, said officials at Inca Digital that had been asked to lend help.

""It's likely happening to more people than we know about,"" said Adam Zarazinski, CEO of analytics and risk-intelligence company Inca Digital, in a CoinDesk interview. Getting the word out, he said, might warn others that this has been happening in the run-up to FTX payouts  starting to go out this week .  The stolen funds were quickly laundered through non-U.S. exchanges including Binance, and it remains unclear whether federal law enforcement officials are pursuing data on the involved exchanges. Inca Digital detailed the scam in a report released on Tuesday. The criminal collapse of the global FTX exchange left billions in assets to be distributed to creditors in a process that's supposed to start  as soon as next week . Naturally, a secondary market  has developed  for the sums yet to be distributed. Some of the conclusions in Inca's report are evidence-backed guesses as to what happened, the document notes. But the person or people behind the reported theft are said to have made video calls to speak with staffs of the firms buying claims, and in those calls, the video passed initial muster but subsequently raised questions about whether it was real — an increasingly common occurrence during the  rise of AI fakery . Besides the allegedly fraudulent video presence, the buyers were also shown identification that had been faked, provided with false addresses in Singapore and were — possibly most importantly — given real claim data. Such data is sometimes publicly available online, but it's also been the subject of data breaches from firms involved in the bankruptcy proceedings, the report said. Zarazinski said that this kind of theft may increasingly prey on the surging crypto markets, especially considering the recent boost in industry activity from the administration of President Donald Trump.

The CoinDesk 20 Index is down around 2.3% over the past day, and the near- to medium-term market movement probably hinges on how the  U.S.-Russia negotiations in Riyadh  go. The talks are focusing not only on ending the conflict in Ukraine, but also on “normalization” of ties between the countries. An additional layer of uncertainty comes from FTX Digital Markets, the Bahamas-based subsidiary of FTX, which starts repaying creditors today. In total, FTX’s repayment program will be around $16 billion. The liquidity injection will come in the form of stablecoins. First up are creditors with claims under $50,000, who will receive roughly 119% of their adjudicated claim value, with 9% annual interest accrued since November 2022. The effect the repayments will have  is unclear. While some analysts say the amount being repaid now is “too small to move the needle,” others suggest that FTX’s historic interest in the Solana ecosystem means some of these funds will flow toward it. Investors have recently turned their attention to ether. U.S.-listed spot ETFs offering exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization are seeing a  cumulative net inflow of $393 million  this month. That compares with a net outflow of $376 million for spot bitcoin ETFs. These inflows come ahead of Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade entering its testing phase on the Holesky testnet. Pectra should bring a number of improvements to scalability and security and will let users pay for gas fees with tokens other than ether. Elsewhere, individual investors are bearish amid trade-war threats, reduced interest-rate cut expectations, and consistent  inflationary surprises . A survey from the American Association of Individual Investors found that bearishness among investors is at a two-year high, the  Wall Street Journal  reports. This pessimism, however, is often a contrarian indicator. Institutional investors’ risk appetite has also dropped this month over the potential effects of a potential trade war amid the lowering odds of a Fed rate cut. Stay alert!

It is our way of honoring Sam’s trust, the monumental work he’s created, and—above all—the shared values that underpin it,"" Kanbus  posted  on X The purchase comes alongside a timely boost to the NFT sector following a marketing push from NFT platform OpenSea that includes a  token airdrop . Trading volume hit $40 million over the past 24 hours, a 29% rise on the previous day according to  CoinGecko . However, the NFT market as a whole has failed to replicate the dizzying heights of previous cycles; activity is down and general sentiment is also waning as floor prices of collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club and are down by 71% and 91% respectively. Much of the market's plight is connected to this cycle's $73 billion rise of memecoins, which retail investors appear to prefer due to minimal transaction fees, more liquidity and a lower barrier for entry. But perhaps Kanbas' $3 million purchase demonstrates a maturing of the NFT market away from speculative profile picture (PFP) collections and towards real art, the value of which lies in the adoration of a few as opposed to the attention of many. The rapid growth of NFTs in 2022 was addictive; it captured millions of participants and racked up billions of dollars in weekly volume, but the market itself was unsustainable. When underlying assets used to purchase digital art began to tumble, NFT collectors attempted to cut losses by undercutting other sellers —creating a liquidity crunch and eventual cascade. All speculative bubbles pop at some point, the majority of 2017 ICO tokens are no longer operational but the ones that still exist are worth billions.

In a conversation with Coffeezilla, Portnoy said that he knew about the project for weeks before the launch and that he purchased the tokens 10 minutes after Milei's tweet.  That Portnoy knew LIBRA so early and that he received a refund afterwards raises the specter of insider trading. But Davis dismissed that idea. ""The idea of insiders is always bullshit because every memecoin I've ever known or invested in or been a part of, the people that benefit are the people that know ... people that structure the deal.

Activity in the U.S.-listed spot ETFs indicates that traders have strongly pivoted to ether from bitcoin (BTC). This month, the nine ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the U.S. have recorded a cumulative net inflow of $393 million, according to data from  Farside Investors . This figure is also seven times larger than the inflows seen in January, as reported by Glassnode. Notably, these funds experienced outflows on only two trading days. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today .   See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms of use  and  privacy policy . In contrast, the 11 bitcoin ETFs have faced a  net outflow  of $376 million this month. Sentiment has been so weak that these funds have recorded inflows on just four trading days. The pivot to ETH is driven by  carry trading , which involves purchasing spot ETFs and shorting ETH CME futures simultaneously. Plus, some of the inflows into ETFs could be outright bullish directional plays. However, investors' pivot to ether has not yet translated into higher prices for cryptocurrency. ETH, which powers Ethereum's smart contract blockchain, has primarily traded between $2,600 and $2,800 since the Feb. 3 crash. Bitcoin too has been locked in a narrow range below $100,000 amid volatile price action in memecoins. Still, some observers expect ether price gains on the back of Ethereum's impending Pectra upgrade, which is said to optimize both the execution and consensus layers of Ethereum and help it compete against rival Layer 1s such as Solana. ""ETH has a solid foundation for a resurgence. The Pectra upgrade, scheduled for April 8 for example, is bringing network improvements, faster transactions, and better staking mechanics,"" Nick Forster, founder of the decentralized options platform Derive.xyz said in an email. Forster explained that Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin's push for a 10x increase in the L1 gas limit points to improved application development and security. Further, the ETH Foundation's recent $120 million allocation to DeFi projects is signaling a renewed focus on adoption and institutional interest through ETHrealize. Led by Vivek Raman, ETHrealize aims to integrate traditional financial institutions into the blockchain world.
